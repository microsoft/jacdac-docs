# Single Wire Serial (SWS)

Jacdac connects microcontrollers (MCUs) to each other using a UART-based protocol on a single (common) data wire
and common ground that form a shared bus. Communications can be implemented on nearly all MCUs, including very 
low cost ones, as detailed in [hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements). A simple way to implement SWS 
is to use a standard RS232 UART peripheral, common to many microcontrollers, operated in half-duplex mode.

## Protocol overview

A complete Jacdac transmission and the beginning of another are captured in the image below.

Data bytes are 10 bits long and are composed of 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. 
Jacdac devices must only communicate at 1 Mbaud and when no data is being transmitted, 
the bus must read as a logical one.

In Jacdac SWS, any device can initiate a transmission at any time.
Because of this, devices must assert control over the bus before sending any data. 
This is where Jacdac differs from half-duplex UART–––devices must assert control over the bus 
by pulsing the line low before transmitting any data. This low pulse is known as the start pulse 
and must be between 11 and 15 microseconds in duration. This duration is recognized 
as a break condition on most UART hardware.

When the start pulse is over, devices have minimally 50 microseconds to configure IO registers 
to receive UART data. If no data byte is received within 200 microseconds, 
an error condition must be triggered and devices must wait for the bus to return to an idle state. 
This means that the first data byte must commence at 189 microseconds 
after the completion of the start pulse in order to be specification compliant.
Devices should strive to start transmission as close as possible after the 50 microsecond mark.

After the transmitter has sent the data portion of a frame, it must then pulse 
the line low one final time to signal the end of a transmission. 
The duration of this end pulse is also between 11 and 15 microseconds so to trigger 
another UART break condition. The end pulse can come immediately after the last data byte, 
but it must occur within 80 microseconds of the last data byte. If it does not, 
an error condition is generated.

A small amount of time must pass before another transmission can begin. 
Devices must wait minimally 100 microseconds plus a randomly generated backoff value 
so that multiple devices do not initiate transmission at precisely the same time. 
It is therefore extremely important that all devices have some randomness in their transmission sequence
to reduce the likelihood of data loss.

## Hardware requirements

As yet, there is no silicon implementation of Jacdac SWS. 
However, the diversity of readily-available microcontrollers and the flexibility of
typical UART hardware means there are many ways to reach a specification compliant 
Jacdac SWS implementation. It is also possible to implement Jacdac SWS by bit-banging, 
if UART hardware is not available.

Jacdac SWS requires the following basic functionality of hardware:

* Transmitting / receiving UART-style (10 bits: 1 byte, 1 stop bit, 1 start bit) bytes 
at 1Mbaud in half-duplex mode, implemented in hardware or in software via bit-banging.
* A GPIO with an internal or external 300k pull-up and support for interrupts, 
implemented in hardware or in software by spin waiting.
* The ability to keep time (whether through instruction counting or a hardware timer).

### Protocol details

### Transmission sequence

1. Place GPIO in high impedance input mode.
2. Check to see if the line is low.
   - If the line is already low, start the reception sequence instead.
3. Place GPIO pin in output mode
4. Pulse the line low for 11––15 microseconds.
5. Configure the UART peripheral with the correct baud rate and begin transmitting data after (minimally) 40 microseconds.


### Reception sequence

1. Place GPIO in high impedance input mode with a PullUp.
2. Enable GPIO edge interrupts, UART break interrupts, or spin wait until the line goes low.
3. When the start pulse has finished, configure UART registers appropriately. It is better to wait until the start pulse is complete as in some cases UART hardware may incorrectly detect a data byte or trigger an error condition.
4. Receive data until the end pulse is detected.

### Error detection

The image and table below captures key timings of Jacdac SWS.

| Identifier 	| Name 	| Duration min/max (us) 	|
|------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| A          	|Start pulse	|11/15	|
| B          	|Start-data gap	|60/89	|
| C          	|Data-byte gap	|0/80	|
| D          	|Data-end gap	|0/80	|
| E          	|End pulse	|11/15	|
| F          	|Frame-to-frame gap	|200/	|

The state machine below encapsulates how these timings should be used during frame reception:
