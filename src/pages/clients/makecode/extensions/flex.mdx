# Flex

The flex extension (for a flexible/bending sensor) reports the sensor 
value as a floating point value between 0.0 and 100.
The `bending` method returns the current value of the sensor.

The following program outputs the sensor value whenever it changes by 
5:

```blocks
modules.flex1.onBendingChangedBy(5, function() {
    led.plotBarGraph(modules.flex1.bending(), 100)
})
```

# JM Flex v1.0

The [JM Flex v1.0](/devices/microsoft-research/jmflexv10) module has a flexible
sensor that changes in value when bent away from the top of the board (which contains
the blue pre-set resistor - square box).
