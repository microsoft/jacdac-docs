# Planar Position

The planar position sensor typically measures movement on a 2D plane. An arbitrary origin is selected and the distance from the origin is reported by the service.

In this example, we use the `x` position to change the frequency of tones played on the micro:bit. The range is dynamically adjusted by recomputing a `minX` variable.
Note that we check that `frequency > 0` to avoid unwanted frequencies to be played.

```blocks
let x = 0
let minX = 0
let frequency = 0
basic.forever(function () {
    x = modules.planarPosition1.x()
    minX = Math.min(x, minX)
    frequency = 1000 + (x - minX) * 20
    if (frequency > 0) {
        music.playTone(frequency, 20)
    }
})
```
