# Cloud Adapter

Allows to upload data to an IoT cloud provider or receive commands from the cloud.

## Device to cloud

The upload number block allows to upload a label and up to 5 numbers (you can have more in TypeScript).
The data will be cached with a timestamp if the adapter is offline. The format on the cloud side is determined by the vendor specific implementation of the adapter.

Note that the adapter does not filter or compress the data so one needs to make sure to not overflow the cloud service with data.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    modules.cloudAdapter1.uploadNumber(
    "temp",
    input.temperature(),
    0,
    0,
    0
    )
    basic.pause(5000)
})
```

## Cloud to device

One can register handlers for `cloud commands`, identified by a label and receive an array of numbers.
The format on the cloud side is determined by the vendor specific implementation of the adapter.

This program shows a number received from the command `show number`.
```blocks
modules.cloudAdapter1.onCloudCommand("show number", function (value, values) {
    basic.showNumber(value)
})
```

## Azure IoT Hub

Jacdac providers a simulator for a [Azure IoT Hub Cloud Adapter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/) in the dashboard. 

* Open the `start simulator` dialog
* Select `Azure IoT Hub Cloud Adapter`
* Configure the cloud adapter simulator with the device connection key from Azure IoT Hub (primary or secondary).
* Use the [Azure Iot Hub Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) to check that message playloads received from the cloud adapter.

For example, the program below that uploads temperature every 5 seconds

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    modules.cloudAdapter1.uploadNumber("temp", input.temperature())
    basic.pause(5000)
})
```

will generate the following events in the Azure IoT Hub.

```json
{
  "body": {
    "device": "...",
    "label": "temp",
    "values": [
      21
    ]
  },
  "enqueuedTime": "..."
}
```
