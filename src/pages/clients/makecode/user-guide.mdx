# User guide

Please remember that Jacdac only works with the micro:bit V2, though you
can create programs that use the micro:bit and Jacdac simulators without any hardware.

## Jacdac simulators and physical modules

You can use a mix of Jacdac simulators or actual Jacdac modules when programming
the micro:bit. The micro:bit simulator can access physical Jacdac modules connected
to the micro:bit V2 (via a [Jacdaptor](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/))
provided you also have connected MakeCode
to the micro:bit [using WebUSB](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/usb/webusb).

In the example below, we remove the button simulator and
connect a physical keycap module which implements the button service.
The Micro:bit simulator connects to the physical button and uses it in the code.

## Dongle mode: "Only one brain"

To avoid having the micro:bit simulator **and** the physical micro:bit running code **at the same time**,
Jacdac automatically puts the simulator micro:bit (the one running in the web browser) in a **dongle mode** when a physical micro:bit is also detected.
The micro:bit in dongle mode does not execute the user's program.

-   in dongle mode, the micro:bit simulator displays an animation of LED randomly turning on and dimming out.
-   to exit dongle mode, disconnect the physical micro:bit and **press any button or reset**

### Deprecated behavior: physical dongle mode

In pxt-jacdac v1.8.41 and earlier, the dongle behaved a bit differently where both physical and simulated device could become dongle.
The new behavior is designed to provide a better user experience.

## Client role binding

You can provide hints in the client role name in the form of URL query arguments to influence the binding algorithm:

```sts
export const btnB = new modules.ButtonClient("A?dev=self&srvo=1")
```

Supported arguments are:

-  `dev=[id]` where `[id]` is the full device id or shortid. `self` is a special name that refers to the micro:bit device itself, it is used for servers.
-  `srvi=[index]` where `[index]` is the service index
-  `srvo=[index]` where `[index]` is the service offset, an index that only takes into account services of the same type.

## Multiple Roles

When running your code, Jacdac binds the modules detected on the bus with the **roles** defined in your program.
Each service comes with a default role which is typically what you start with. For example `button1` is the default role for buttons.

```blocks
modules.button1.onEvent(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Up, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
```

However, if you want to create a program with multiple buttons, you will need to define additional roles in your program.

### Blocks editor

-   Open the **Modules** drawer
-   Click **Configure Roles** to open the roles editor
-   Add and remove roles
-   Press **Save** and go back to the editor

Once reloaded, you should be able to select your roles in the block drop downs.

### JavaScript editor

Unfortunately, the role editor is not yet available in the JavaScript view. So you are left with two choices

1. go to blocks, add roles, go back to JavaScript
2. add the roles manually by instantiating clients, as shown below

```sts
export const dotMatrix2 = new modules.DotMatrixClient("dot Matrix2")
```

## Role lifecycle

Each role, like `button1` defined in the MakeCode program needs to be bound to a server (module) before it starts to operate.
When the micro:bit starts or when a new module is plugged, it may take a couple seconds before roles around bound (there is some time needed to discover modules on the bus).
This means that typically roles are not yet bound when running the `on start` block.

Instead of using `on start`, you can use `on connected` and `on disconnected`
to start or stop using a role.

```blocks
modules.button1.onConnectionChanged(jacdac.ClientConnectionState.Connected, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Happy)
})
modules.button1.onConnectionChanged(jacdac.ClientConnectionState.Disconnected, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Sad)
})
```

## Updating Jacdac Extensions

Sometimes, you may have to update the Jacdac extension used in your project. This happens when we fix a bug or add a new feature!

-   switch to Javascript using the language button
-   expand the **Explorer** tree view
-   click on the update icon next to the jacdac extension entry
-   That's it!
