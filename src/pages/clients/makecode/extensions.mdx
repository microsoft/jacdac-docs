# Extensions

Most Jacdac [services](/services) have a corresponding [MakeCode extension](https://makecode.com/extensions).
Visit the links below to learn how to program with each such extension:

<MakeCodeExtensions />

## Advanced

Most of the above extensions are automatically generated from the Jacdac service specifications, 
via tooling in the [jacdac repository](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac),
and hosted as subdirectories in the [pxt-jacdac repository](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac),
which also contains the Jacdac protocol and runtime support (at the top-level).
