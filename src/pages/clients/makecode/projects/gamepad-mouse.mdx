# Gamepad to HID Mouse

This simple example uses two Jacdac modules to translate the (x,y)
position of a joysick to HID mouse motion. In addition to a brain
module (such as micro:bit V2) to run the following program, you will
need:
- the [JM Analog Joystick v0.2](/devices/microsoft-research/jmanalogjoystick44v02) module
- the [JM Brain F4 v0.2](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainf441v02) or [JM Brain RP2040 v0.1](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainrp204059v01) module,
  loaded with the HID Keyboard + Mouse firmware that is available via the same links
  
The following program deals with noise from the joystick by only sending
a HID event when the value is well above noise threshold. The program can be loaded 
onto a micro:bit, which should be connected to the HID module via
Jacdac. The HID module is then connected to your desktop/laptop via USB. 

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let dx = modules.gamepad1.x()
    let dy = modules.gamepad1.y()
    if (Math.abs(dx) > 20 || Math.abs(dy) > 20) {
        modules.hidMouse1.move(dx / 4, dy / 4)
    }
})
```
