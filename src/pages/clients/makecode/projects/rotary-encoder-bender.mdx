# Rotary Sound Bender

Bending sounds by changing the start frequency of `play sound` using a [rotary encoder](/clients/makecode/extensions/rotaryencoder).

## Play a sound

Let's start by dragging `play sound` block from the `music` toolbox into the `forever` loop.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 5000, 0, 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Bending the sound

We'll read the rotary encoder position and use it as a duration for the sound.
Since the position is a counter (positive or negative), we'll multiply the value by 50 to get a duration in milli seconds (every click is 50ms).

-   click on the (+) button in the play sound to expand the options
-   drag a `(*)` multiply block from Math and set one side as `50`
-   drag a `rotary encoder 1 position (#)` block from the `modules` toolbox
-   if you cannot find this block, start a _rotary encoder_ simulator in Jacdac and click **Import blocks**

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(
    WaveShape.Sine,
    5000,
    0,
    255,
    0,
    50 * modules.rotaryEncoder1.position(),
    SoundExpressionEffect.None,
    InterpolationCurve.Linear
    ), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Test your counter in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `rotary encoder` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one.
Try moving the slider to test the different sounds.

## Download to your micro:bit V2

Connect your micro:bit V2, slot it into the Jacdaptor and connect a Jacdac rotary encoder.
Press the **Download** button to get your code running on the micro:bit.
