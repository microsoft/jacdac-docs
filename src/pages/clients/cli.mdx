# CLI

The [Jacdac Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-cli)
provides various tools to work with Jacdac.

## Installation

-   Install [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) 14+
-   Install the tool globally.

```
npm install -g jacdac-cli
```

## Usage

### `jacdac parse`

Parses a logic analyzer log and replays the packets

```
jacdac parse log.txt
```

### `jacdac devtools`

Starts a local websocket server that acts as a bridge between a web dashboard and a client implementation. This allows to test a native client using the latest version of the web developer tools.

```

You can use this mode to test a client implementation and use the web site debugging tools.
