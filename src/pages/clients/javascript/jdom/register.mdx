# JDRegister

> A **register** is a [JDOM](/clients/javascript/jdom/) [node](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/) that represents an addressed data location
on a [service](/clients/javascript/jdom/service/), that may be get, set or streamed. 

This object inherits methods and properties from [node](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/).

## Methods

### ``data``

Returns register raw data state as a ``Uint8Array``.

```typescript
const data = register.data;
```

### ``unpackedValue``

Unpacks the register data into a packed array.

```typescript
const [x, y, z] = register.unpackedValue as [number, number, number]
```

### ```objectValue```

Unpacks the register data into an object and fields.

```typescript
const { x, y, z } = register.objectValue
```

### ``intValue``

Reads register value as a signed integer. ``undefined`` is no data is available.

```typescript
const i = register.intValue
```

### ``boolValue``

Reads register value as a boolean value. ``undefined`` is no data is available.

```typescript
const b = register.boolValue
```

### ``stringValue``

Reads register value as a string value. ``undefined`` is no data is available.

```typescript
const s = register.stringValue
```

### ``sendSetAsync``

Sends data to set the register value. This function returns a promise.

```typescript
await service.sendSetAsync(data)
```

### ``sendSetIntAsync``

Sends signed integer to set the register value. This function returns a promise.

```typescript
await service.sendSetIntAsync(42)
```


### ``sendSetBoolAsync``

Sends boolean value to set the register value. This function returns a promise.

```typescript
await service.sendSetBoolAsync(true)
```

### ``sendSetStringAsync``

Sends boolean value to set the register value. This function returns a promise.

```typescript
await service.sendSetStringAsync(":)")
```

## Events

### ``REPORT_RECEIVE``

Raised after a report is received.

```typescript
register.on(REPORT_RECEIVE, reg => console.log(reg))
```

### ``REPORT_UPDATE``

Raised when a report was received that introduced a change to the register data.
