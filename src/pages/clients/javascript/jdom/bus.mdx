# JDBus

A **bus** is the top-level [JDOM](/clients/javascript/jdom/) [node](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/).
It processes the incoming and outcoming packets, 
handles the connection to the underlying communiction transport
and maintains a set of active [devices](/clients/javascript/jdom/device/) nodes.

* [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/classes/JDBus.html)

## WebUSB bus

The most common use is to create a bus that uses WebUSB to
communicate to a physical Jacdac device. This is done with ``createUSBBus``.

```vanilla
import { createUSBBus } from "jacdac-ts"

const bus = createUSBBus();
-----
import {} from "jacdac-ts"

// listen for changes
bus.on(CHANGE, () => log(bus))
```

## Connection and disconnection

By default, the WebUSB bus will try to reconnect 
to any known connected physical device. The Jacdac physical device hasn't been paired yet,
you can initiate the connection from a user interaction handler (security measure as the user must manually pick the device).

```vanilla
await bus.connect();
-----
import {} from "jacdac-ts"

// listen for changes
bus.on(CHANGE, () => log(bus))
```

The bus will detect that the physical device is disconnected automatically. If you wish to disconnect manually, use

```javascript
await bus.disconnect();
```

You can query the status of the connection using ``bus.connectionState``. The connection has 4 states:

* connected: connected to a physical device over WebUSB and receiving packets
* connection: connection in progress (for example, user is selecting the device)
* disconnected: no active connection to a physical device
* disconnecting: closing the connection to the physical device

Using the ``CONNECTION_STATE`` event, you can track changes of the state.

```vanilla
// am i connected?
const connected = bus.connected
// track connection state
bus.on(CONNECTION_STATE, () => {
    console.log(`connected: ${bus.connected}`)
})
-----
import { } from "jacdac-ts"

// am i connected?
log(`connected: ${bus.connected}`)
// track connection state
bus.on(CONNECTION_STATE, () => log(`connected: ${bus.connected}`))
```

## Recipes

### Listing devices

You can query the bus at receive a snapshot of the [devices](/clients/javascript/jdom/device).

```vanilla
const devices = bus.devices()
for(const device of devices)
    console.log(device)
-----
import { DEVICE_ANNOUNCE } from "jacdac-ts"

log(`connect to see devices`)
// listen for device announcing services
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, () => {
    // query the current list of devices
    const devices = bus.devices()
    // print to console
    log("")
    for(const device of devices)
        log(device)
})
```


### Filtering devices

One can apply various filters to select devices. For example, using the ``serviceClass`` filters
to collect devices with buttons.

```vanilla
import { SRV_BUTTON } from "jacdac-ts"

const devicesWithButtons = bus.devices({ serviceClass: SRV_BUTTON })
for(const device of devicesWithButtons)
    console.log(device)
-----
import { DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, SRV_BUTTON } from "jacdac-ts"

log(`connect to see buttons`)
// listen for device announcing services
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, () => {
    // query the current list of devices
    const devicesWithButtons = bus.devices({ serviceClass: SRV_BUTTON })
    log("")
    for(const device of devicesWithButtons)
        console.log(device)
})
```

### Filtering services

One can apply various filters to select devices. For example, using the ``serviceClass`` filters
to collect devices with buttons.

```vanilla
import { SRV_BUTTON } from "jacdac-ts"

const services = bus.services({ serviceClass: SRV_BUTTON })
for(const service of services)
    console.log(service)
-----
import { DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, SRV_BUTTON } from "jacdac-ts"

log(`connect to see buttons`)
// listen for device announcing services
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, () => {
    // query button services
    const services = bus.services({ serviceClass: SRV_BUTTON })
    for(const service of services)
        console.log(service)
})
```


## Events

All bus state mutation are advertised by events. You can listen or subscribe to those events.

### ``CHANGE``

Catch all event raised when some change happened to the bus, whether it is a connection change or a change in the list of services
or the error state changed.

```vanilla
import { CHANGE } from "jacdac-ts"

bus.on(CHANGE, () => {
    const devices = bus.devices()
    for(const device of devices)
        console.log(device)
})
-----
import { } from "jacdac-ts"

log(`connect to see devices`)
// listen for device announcing services
bus.on(CHANGE, () => {
    // query the current list of devices
    const devices = bus.devices()
    // print to console
    log(`connected: ${bus.connected}`)
    for(const device of devices)
        log(device)
})
```


### ``ERROR``

An error occured.

```javascript
bus.on(ERROR, { context, exception } => console.error(`bus error: ${context}`, exception))
```
