# Debugging

## Dev tools

Jacdac provides various tools in this web site to diagnose issues with modules.
The dashboard also provides the ability to start virtual modules which tends to be very useful when debugging Jacdac programs.

When building web-based Jacdac programs, using our Javascript SDK (or P5\*js...), you can use the devtools to side load your Jacdac-enabled web page with our developer tools
**or** inject the dashboard as an i-frame into your page.

Add your url as a hash to auto-load it.

    https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/javascript/devtools#URL

where `URL` is your web page url.

## Device Tree

The [device tree](/software/device-tree) allows to explore the JDOM tree: device, services, registers, events.
The value of each register and also count events being triggered.

## Packet Console

The [packet console](/software/packet-console), available from the device tree, lets you investigate, filter packet traces.
Each packet can be decoded and inspected.

Traces can be saved, reloaded for offline invesgitation.
