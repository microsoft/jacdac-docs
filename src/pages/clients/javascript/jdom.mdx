# JDOM

The JDOM module is a dependency-free JavaScript object model
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements:

-   A **[bus](/clients/javascript/jdom/bus/)** is made of connected devices.
-   A **[device](/clients/javascript/jdom/device/)** may host **services**.
-   A **[service](/clients/javascript/jdom/service/)** has **[registers](/clients/javascript/jdom/register/)** and **[events](/clients/javascript/jdom/event/)**, accepts **commands**,
    and may return **acks**.
-   A **[register](/clients/javascript/jdom/register/)** is an addressed data location, organized in **[fields](/clients/javascript/jdom/field/)**,
    , that may be get, set or streamed.
-   Virtual servers to simulate devices.

All the above elements are [nodes](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/) in the [JDOM](/clients/javascript/jdom/). All elements implement a event emitter and observable pattern to
easily data-bind them in a variety of UI frameworks.

## JavaScript/TypeScript ES6

If you are using JavaScript/TypeScript ES6, import all APIs and spin off a WebUSB bus to get started.
The example below displays device that get announced on the bus.

```vanilla
import { createUSBBus, DEVICE_ANNOUNCE } from "jacdac-ts"

const bus = createUSBBus();
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, device => log(device))
// call connect from a user interaction
bus.connect();
-----
import { DEVICE_ANNOUNCE } from "jacdac-ts"

// listen for new device
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, device => log(device))
```

## Node.JS CommonJS/ES6

In Node.JS, you can use the `require` (CommonJS) or `import` (ES6) approach to use JDOM.
Since JDOM is using the [node-usb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) npm package, make sure to configure your machine to use USB.

```typescript
import { createUSBBus, createNodeUSBOptions, ... } from "jacdac-ts"

const options = createNodeUSBOptions()
const bus = createUSBBus(options);
...
```

## Vanilla JavaScript

If you wish to use the library from a CDN or directly from a test web page, you can use the precompiled
`jacdac.js` file. All exported symbols are imported into the `jacdac` name.

See [tools](/tools/) for example of vanilla HTML/JavaScript pages using the library.
