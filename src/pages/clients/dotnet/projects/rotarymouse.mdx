# Rotary Encoder to HID mouse wheel

This sample uses a special HID server module, so that you
can use a Jacdac rotary module to act as a mouse wheel.
In addition to a brain module (such as micro:bit V2) 
you will need:
- the [JM Rotary Control](/devices/microsoft-research/jmrotarycontrolbuttonv10) module
- the [JM Brain F4 v0.2](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainf441v02) or [JM Brain RP2040 v0.1](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainrp204059v01) module,
  loaded with the HID Keyboard + Mouse firmware that is available via the same links
  
The HID module should be connected via USB to the desktop/laptop for the mouse to work.
