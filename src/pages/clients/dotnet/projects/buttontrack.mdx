# Button Tracker

This sample shows how to listen for [button](/services/button) events like `up`, `down` and `hold`.

After creating the `bus` client, you can simply add your handler to the `Up`, `Down` or `Hold` events.
Once the client is bound to a service, the events generated by the button will automatically be routed
to the client.
