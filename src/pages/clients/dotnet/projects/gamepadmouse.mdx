# Gamepad to HID Mouse

This simple example uses two Jacdac modules to translate the (x,y)
position of a joysick to HID mouse motion. In addition to a brain
module (such as micro:bit V2) to run the following program, you will
need:
- the [JM Analog Joystick v0.2](/devices/microsoft-research/jmanalogjoystick44v02) module
- the [JM Brain F4 v0.2](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainf441v02) or [JM Brain RP2040 v0.1](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainrp204059v01) module,
  loaded with the HID Keyboard + Mouse firmware that is available via the same links
  
The HID module should be connected via USB to the desktop/laptop for the mouse to work.
