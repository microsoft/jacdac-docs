# Slidy Blinky

This sample show how to blink an [LED](/services/led) module and change the brightness using a [slider](/services/slider).

After creating the `led` client, we register to the `Connected` event to run code while a LED is available.
In the `Connected` handler, we start a loop where we alternate sending commands between red and blue.
