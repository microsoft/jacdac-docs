# Getting started

** You do not need any hardware to do this tutorial. **

In this tutorial, we'll install the .NET tool and build a small
application that controls an LED with a button.

### Launch the [developer tools](/clients/dotnet/devtools/)

Start a devtools server and open the dashboard at http://localhost:8081/.
We'll be able to create simulated buttons in the dashboard.

```
> jacdac.devtools
```

To install this tool, run

```
dotnet tool install -g jacdac.devtools
```

### Setting up your project in .NET cli + VS Code

If you are using the .NET cli, create a new console application

```
dotnet new console
```

and add Jacdac nuget packages.

```
dotnet add package jacdac.net
dotnet add package jacdac.net.clients
dotnet add package jacdac.net.transports.websockets
```

Launch Visual Studio Code with the C# extension or Visual Studio to build your project.
```
code .
```

### Start the Jacdac bus

Let's start by creating a Jacdac bus connected to the [devtools](/clients/dotnet/devtools/).

```cs
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Transports.WebSockets;

var bus = new JDBus(WebSocketTransport.Create());
// keep the app alive, make sure it comes last
Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
```

Launch your app and go back to the dashboard. You should see a new device, 
mostly empty.

### Let there be a button

We instantiate a `ButtonClient` class by passing the `bus`
and the **role** name. The role name will be also displayed in the 
web dashboard.

```cs
using Jacdac.Clients;
...
var button = new ButtonClient(bus, "btn");
```

For tinkering purposes, we add event handler to the `Down` event 
and display something on the console.

```cs
button.Down += (s,e) => Console.WritLine("down");
```

The `button` client will automatically be bound to a [button service](/services/button/)
once the role manager finds one on the bus. 

Launch your application, go to the dashboard. 
Start a button simulator, as Jacdac binds the `button` role to that simulated service, you will
see the `btn` name show up in the user interface.
You should see the `down` message show up on your console application.

If you have a physical Jacdac button module, you can connect it to the dashboard and use it as well.

### Let there be light

Similarly to the button, we add a `LedClient` and use `SetColor` control it's color.
We change the `Down` handler to show red color (in the same format as hex HTML colors)
and `Up` to turn off the LED.

```cs
var led = new LedClient(bus, "led");
// colors
uint red = 0xff0000;
uint off = 0x000000;
// show red when down
button.Down += (s,e) => led.SetColor(red);
// show up when up
button.Up += (s,e) => led.SetColor(off);
```

Launch your application and go back to the dashboard. 
Start an LED simulator and see that it gets bound. Test that when you press the button,
the LED goes red and back when the button is released.

## Blink

```cs
uint blue = 0x0000ff;
// show switch between red and blue
var counter = 0;
button.Down += (s,e) => led.SetColor(counter++ % 2 == 0 ? blue : red);
```

Launch again your application and see that you get a nice blinking effect of the LED.

That's it your code is ready, you can now deploy to your [Raspberry Pi](/clients/dotnet/pi/) or other platforms.

```cs
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Clients;
using Jacdac.Transports.WebSockets;

var bus = new JDBus(WebSocketTransport.Create());
var button = new ButtonClient(bus, "btn");
var led = new LedClient(bus, "led");

uint red = 0xff0000;
uint blue = 0x0000ff;
uint off = 0;

var counter = 0;
button.Down += (s,e) => led.SetColor(red);
button.Up += (s,e) => led.SetColor(off);
button.Hold += (s,e) => led.SetColor(counter++ % 2 == 0 ? blue : red);

// keep the app alive
Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
```
