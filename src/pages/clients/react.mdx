# React package

This package provides a [context](/clients/react/setup/) and [hooks](/clients/react/hooks/) to interact with the bus within a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
It is built on top of the [JavaScript package](/clients/javascript).

-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/react-jacdac)
-   [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/react-jacdac/) for a full list of hooks.

## Getting started

Before getting into the details of the setup, let's build a tiny app that lets you control the
background color of a `div` using a Jacdac slider. (If you want to skip ahead, read the [setup](/clients/react/setup) page).

We start by retreiving any potentiometer attached to the bus using the `useServices` hook.
The `useServices` hook returns list of a [potentiometer service nodes](/services/potentiometer/) (`SRV_POTENTIOMETER`) on the bus.
The service JDOM nodes mirror the state of the physical services (although we could support multiple sliders, we simply grab the first).

```tsx
// auto-update list of slider services on the jacdac bus
const service = useServices({ serviceClass: SRV_POTENTIOMETER })[0]
```

From reading the [potentiometer service specification](/services/potentiometer), we know that should read the `position` register.
The `useRegister` hook returns the register JDOM node that mirrors the state of the physical register 
(you will find pregenerated constants like `PotentiometerReg` for every services).

```tsx
// the position register returns a 0..1 value
const positionRegister = useRegister(service, PotentiometerReg.Position)
```

The `useRegisterValue` unpacks latest data received from the bus and returns the data as an array.
Since the position register has a single filed, we destructure the array into a variable `position`
which holds a floating point number between 0 and 1.
The hook will trigger a render whenever it receives new data 
and it also makes sure that the bus keeps refreshing the value of that register.

```tsx
// read and decode the value
const [position] = useRegisterValue<[number]>(positionRegister)
```

Once you have the value, we generate a HSL color and stuff it into the style of a div...

```tsx
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: `hsl(${position * 360}, 50%, 50%)`,

        ...}} />
```

All together the demo looks like this (you can open it up in codesandbox to try it out!)

```tsx
const Demo = () => {
  // auto-update list of slider services on the jacdac bus
  const service = useServices({ serviceClass: SRV_POTENTIOMETER })[0];
  // the position register returns a 0..1 value
  const positionRegister = useRegister(service, PotentiometerReg.Position);
  // read and decode the value
  const [position] = useRegisterValue<[number]>(positionRegister);
  // position is undefined if data is unavailable
  if (position === undefined) return null;
  // we have a position reading! (between 0 and 1)
  // draw a colored rectangle
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: `hsl(${position * 360}, 50%, 50%)`,
        width: `10rem`,
        height: `10rem`,
        borderRadius: `1rem`
      }}
    />
  );
};

import React from "react";
import { SRV_POTENTIOMETER, PotentiometerReg } from "jacdac-ts";
import { useServices, useRegister, useRegisterValue } from "react-jacdac";

const Demo = () => {
  // auto-update list of slider services on the jacdac bus
  const service = useServices({ serviceClass: SRV_POTENTIOMETER })[0];
  // the position register returns a 0..1 value
  const positionRegister = useRegister(service, PotentiometerReg.Position);
  // read and decode the value
  const [position] = useRegisterValue<[number]>(positionRegister);
  // position is undefined if data is unavailable
  if (position === undefined) return null;
  // we have a position reading! (between 0 and 1)
  // draw a colored rectangle
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: `hsl(${position * 360}, 50%, 50%)`,
        width: `10rem`,
        height: `10rem`,
        borderRadius: `1rem`
      }}
    />
  );
};

export default Demo;
```

## Next steps

-   [setup](/clients/react/setup/), you need to mount the `JacdacContext` in your React tree
-   [hooks](/clients/react/hooks/), integrate Jacdac in your React app with the hooks

## Developing with simulators

Using the [Jacdac Dev Tools](/clients/javascript/devtools), you can test your code against simulated Jacdac modules. Open the devtools, copy your locally hosted URL and get started!
