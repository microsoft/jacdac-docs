# DeviceScript

[Microsoft DeviceScript](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/) is a TypeScript-like language and portable runtime built on top of Jacdac service abstractions.

DeviceScript comes with a full Visual Studio Code integration,
with TypeScript syntax and type checking, debugging
and live device interaction.

```typescript
import { AirPressure } from "@devicescript/core"
import { ewma, throttleTime } from "@devicescript/observables"
import { publishMessage } from "@devicescript/cloud"

const barometer = new AirPressure()
const { reading: pressure } = barometer
pressure.pipe(ewma(0.9), throttleTime(5000)).subscribe(async p => {
    console.data({ p })
    await publishMessage("pressure", { p })
})
```

## Jacdac and DeviceScript

DeviceScript uses the Jacdac services to provide an abstraction layer between the physical hardware and the scripts.
