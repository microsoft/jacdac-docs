# DeviceScript (beta)

Microsoft DeviceScript is a TypeScript-like language and portable runtime built on top of Jacdac service abstractions.

DeviceScript comes with a full Visual Studio Code integration,
with TypeScript syntax and type checking, debugging
and live device interaction.

```typescript
const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
// listen for pressure changes
sensor.pressure.onChange(10, () => {
    // read sensor reading
    const pressure = sensor.pressure.read()
    console.log(pressure)
})
```

## Jacdac and DeviceScript

DeviceScript uses the Jacdac services to provide an abstraction layer between the physical hardware and the scripts.
