# Error Jacdac missing

## The problem

Jacdac is not installed by default on your micro:bit so you need to download a program using
the Jacdac library to enabled it.

## How to fix it

Essentially, you need to add the **Jacdac** extension to any of your micro:bit V2 project to add Jacdac support.

-   go to https://makecode.microbit.org/
-   open an existing or new project
-   go to **Extensions** and search for https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-Jacdac
-   select the **Jacdac** library
-   download to your micro:bit
