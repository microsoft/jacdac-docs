# Error micro:bit V1 not supported

## The problem

Jacdac does not support the micro:bit V1 hardware. Please try again with a micro:bit V2 or higher hardware revision.

## How to fix it

Unfortunately there is no software fix for this issue. You will need to get a micro:bit V2 or newer board in order to get Jacdac to work on the hardware.

## Workaround

 You can still use the MakeCode simulator to simulate a micro:bit V2. The simulator will communicate with the Jacdac devices as if it was the real physical micro:bit.
