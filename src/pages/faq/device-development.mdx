## Can I make existing hardware work with Jacdac?

Yes! Jacdac is designed to be interoperable with a wide range of existing platforms via [Jacdaptors](/reference/jacdaptors/). 

In some cases it's possible to use Jacdac without any new hardware at all! See how Jacdac provides a [software-only](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory) solution for existing micro:bit accessories.

## How can I add the Jacdac edge connector to my hardware?

We've tried to make it easy to add Jacdac. 

Firstly, you need to add the [PCB edge connector](https://aka.ms/jacdac-edge-connector). Your PCB **must be 1.6mm thick** and use gold plating to use Jacdac; if this is not possible then consider mounting a small Jacdac PCB onto your main PCB. There are more details [here](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical/#pcb-edge-connector).

Next, you need to add the Jacdac interface circuitry. At the very least there are a few passive components/diodes, see [here](/ddk/design/electrical/#signalling). The filtered Jacdac bus data line, JD_POWER_MCU, must be connected to a microcontroller (MCU) that's running the Jacdac protocol. If your hardware already has an MCU, this may be sufficient; but it's also possible to add an MCU. Either way, we have [reference firmware implementations](/ddk/firmware/) of the Jacdac protocol. 

You need to decide on the best [power supply scheme](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing), depending on the user experience you want to deliver. Jacdac modules that don't draw a lot of current are probably best implemented as pure power consumers, requiring only a cheap voltage regulator. Jacdac brains, that users are likely to plug other Jacdac modules into, are probably best as power providers—which means they need to have a simple current limiter circuit. 

## Can I modify an existing Jacdac device design?

Yes! We provide a number of Jacdac device hardware and firmware reference designs with an open license for the community to use as-is and modify. If you do this, we'd love it if you share the things you build so that others may benefit in turn—but don't feel obligated to do this.

## Do EC30 devices have to be rectangular?

No, not exactly!

The EC30 form factor requires four mounting holes on a rectangular layout. If the holes have a separation of  x and y mm, both x and y must be multiples of 10mm. Also, the outline of the device must not extend beyond a rectangle of size (x + 5) mm and (y + 5) mm. 

There must be at least one edge connector on the left-hand side of the module, and it must be essentially in-line with the two left-most holes, as per the [EC30 specification](https://aka.ms/jacdac-ec30). There must also be a notch along the top edge, next to mounting hole 1, and there must be PCB material adjacent to all other mounting holes in the position where the mounting hole 1 notch is. (We call these 'anti-notches'.) 

Other than the above requirements, modules can have different shapes. Two examples are this [RGB LED module](devices/kittenbot/rgbringv10/) and this [temperature and humidity module](devices/microsoft-research/temprhv11/).


## What voltage does the Jacdac bus run at?

The Jacdac bus (JD_PWR) nominally runs at V<sub>out(nom)</sub> = 5.0V, see the [Jacdac electrical specification](/reference/electrical-spec/#power-providers). However, due to cable resistance there will be a voltage drop on both the out-bound current path and the return current path. At higher currents, this can significantly reduce the bus voltage seen by a [power consuming device](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing). 

Power consuming devices must therefore be designed to operate from a worst-case voltage of V<sub>in(min)</sub>=3.5V. Since devices have to signal at V<sub>OH(nom)</sub> = 3.3V, it is often convenient to use a low drop-out linear regulator (LDO) to regulate the bus voltage to 3.3V for a device's digital logic, for example [these suggested parts](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/generic/suggested-components#linear-regulator-ldo).

## What voltage should a power provider supply?

The Jacdac bus (JD_PWR) nominally runs at V<sub>out(nom)</sub> = 5.0V, see the [Jacdac electrical specification](/reference/electrical-spec/#power-providers). Due to cable resistance there will be a voltage drop on both the out-bound current path and the return current path. This reduces the bus voltage seen by a [power consuming device](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing), by an amount that depends on the current flowing.

The voltage that power providing devices must supply onto the bus therefore depends on how much current they can supply, and is specified [here](/reference/electrical-spec/#power-providers). 

## Is it possible to power the Jacdac bus directly from a 5V USB power supply?

No. 

All power provision onto the Jacdac bus (JD_PWR) **MUST** be through an [electronic current limiter](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-provider-current-limiting) to protect the safety of users. 

## Is it possible to power the Jacdac bus directly from a lithium battery?

No. 

All power provision onto the Jacdac bus (JD_PWR) **MUST** be through an [electronic current limiter](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-provider-current-limiting) to protect the safety of users. 

However, a lithium ion or lithium polymer may be suitable for powering the Jacdac bus (JD_PWR) **if a current limiter is used**. If a lithium battery powered provider supplies 110mA, it will be in spec when supplying down to 3.7V onto the bus. A higher current power supply needs to provide a higher voltage onto the bus and will probably need a DC-DC boost converter to operate effective. See [here](/reference/electrical-spec/#power-providers) for more information about what voltage must be supplied onto the bus at  different currents.

## Is Jacdac limited to 1A of current?

No. 

Any single cable, and as a result, any single section of the Jacdac bus, **is** limited to 1A. This means that individual devices can only consume up to 1A from the Jacdac bus—and in fact we further restrict this to 900mA do accommodate component tolerances. 

However, there are two ways of providing more than 1A to Jacdac devices. Firstly, devices may have an [independent power source](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing-options) that is not limited by the capabilities of the Jacdac bus. But this may not be as convenient as using Jacdac bus power, so the second approach we support is using a Jacdac power supply that provides up to 1A **per connector**. In this case, there is still a 900mA limit for any one Jacdac device that's powered from the bus, but it's possible to have many devices like this in the same Jacdac solution—just plug each one into a separate connector on the power supply. 

## Why is the current limited to ~50mA on some micro:bit Jacdaptors?

There are two reasons why the current is limited to a relatively low value on the micro:bit Jacdaptor:

### Firstly, for safety.
 We don’t ever want more than 1A flowing through the bus due to the rating on the cable, and if we had simply had 1A available on power supplies then users could easily exceed this by connecting more than one together. We have two solutions to this:
1. We limit power supplies to a smaller current. Users can still exceed 1A, but they’d need to connect a lot of supplies together so we think it’s unlikely in practice. The maximum value of this smaller current is I<sub>out(lc)</sub>, see [here](/reference/electrical-spec/#power-providers). Low-cost current limiting chips often have a large tolerance, and one of the parts that's used on Jacdaptors is 75mA ±25mA, so in some cases current might be limited to 50mA.
2.	We do allow power supplies to supply 1A each (I<sub>out(hc)</sub>), but in that case we put intelligence into them so they can detect if more than one is plugged in, in which case all but one of them stop supplying power. This requires firmware running the [power service](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/power/) in the power supply. In the case of the micro:bit Jacdaptor this would add cost because an MCU would need to be added.

### Secondly, to meet the micro:bit accessory specification

The [micro:bit accessory specification limits how much power](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/powersupply/) is taken from its edge connector. Supplying more than 100mA onto the Jacdac bus at ~4V would take too much power at 3.3V from a micro:bit V2 edge connector, hence the reason to limit power to 100mA.
