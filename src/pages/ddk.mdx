# Device Development 

## Overview

The documentation in these pages form the basis for the Jacdac Device Development Kit (DDK). The DDK is for hardware designers, firmware developers and manufacturers who wish to create their own Jacdac [devices](/devices). Important additional materials that are part of the DDK are hosted on separate Github repos for [DDK reference materials](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk) and our various [firmware implementations](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/firmware/).

## What is a Jacdac device?

A Jacdac device should:

-   have a [Jacdac edge connector](./design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) for joining the device to the Jacdac bus
    using [Jacdac cables](./design/electro-mechanical#cable-connectors-and-assemblies);
-   implement the [Jacdac protocol](/reference/protocol/) to communicate over the bus via the connector;
-   follow the [hardware design guidelines](./design/); and
-   pass all the checks in the [device tester](/tools/device-tester/).

There are four main types of Jacdac device: **brains**, **modules**, **power supplies** and adaptors, known as  **Jacdaptors**. More information about these is described in the documentation about Jacdac's [client/server architecture](/reference/clientserver).

## Key steps for creating a new Jacdac device 

The Jacdac DDK supports the development of new Jacdac devices via the following steps:

1. choosing on-board components and incorporating them in a Jacdac-compliant [hardware design](./design);
2. identifying the [services](/services/) to represent the chosen components;
3. building [firmware](./firmware/) to establish [device identity](/reference#device-identification) and
   expose any services on the Jacdac bus;
4. validating the hardware using the [dashboard](/dashboard) and [device tester](/tools/device-tester); and
5. [registering](/tools/device-registration) the device in the Jacdac [device catalog](/devices).

A common realization of a Jacdac device is a printed circuit board (PCB) that includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) connected to a specific set of components including sensors, actuators, network interfaces and/or power supplies. Jacdac devices may supply power to the bus and/or consume power from the bus.  Devices with a USB connection can also support Jacdac over USB to communicate with a web browser.

Our current Jacdac hardware and firmware designs target the [PADAUK 8-bit](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) 
and [STM32x0 32-bit](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0) families of MCUs.
STM32x0 support includes a Jacdac [bootloader service](/services/bootloader/) that allows MCU firmware to be updated over Jacdac.
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of our proven hardware and firmware reference implementations to simplify the above steps.

Hardware reference implementations of Jacdac devices created with popular electronics CAD tools including Altium Designer, Eagle and KiCad are available as part of our
[DDK reference materials](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk).

When the hardware and firmware for a new device has been created, we provide web-based tools that ease verification of the device design. These tools may also be useful for manufacturing validation tests (look for 'factory mode'). We also provide web interface for module creators to [register](/tools/device-registration) their designs in our [device catalog](/devices).

## Interoperability with other platforms

Jacdac is designed to interoperate with many other tools and platforms. The physical and electrical requirements of Jacdac can be provided via a [Jacdaptor](/reference/jacdaptors/) (Jadcac adaptor); the detailed requirements for building a Jacdaptor vary depending on the platform it's designed to work with. 

In the [Jacdac micro:bit interoperability](/ddk/microbit) guide, we document various scenarios for integrating Jacdac with the micro:bit V2. Note that we do not currently plan to support micro:bit V1.
