# IoT Plug And Play Models

This route hosts [DTDL](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) models 
for each [service](/services), similar to https://devicemodels.azure.com/.

The [DTMI](https://github.com/Azure/digital-twin-model-identifier) of each services is formatted based on the class identifier:

    dtmi:jacdac:services:x{id};1

where ``{id}`` is the class identifer rendered as a hex number. 
The route is generated following the conventions from [iot-plugandplay-models](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models#consuming)
where the ``:`` are replaced by ``/``, and ``;`` with ``-``.

    /dtmi/jacdac/services/x{id}-1.json

For example, [https://jacdac-device-models.azurewebsites.net/dtmi/jacdac/services/x1473a263-1.json](https://jacdac-device-models.azurewebsites.net/dtmi/jacdac/services/x1473a263-1.json) 
points to the [button](/services/button) DTDL.

To download all service models, go use [/dtmi/jacdac/services.json](/dtmi/jacdac/services.json)
