# Implementing Software-only Jacdac for micro:bit Accessories

With software-only support for Jacdac, sensors and actuators built into accessories are surfaced as Jacdac servers by wrapping the existing accessory extension with a  Jacdac compatibility layer.
This solution adds no cost and will work for existing accessories.

See the discussion of [Jacdac/micro:bit V2 interoperability](/design/microbit) for a description of the pros and cons of software-only Jacdac support.

## Getting started

**Here is a list of [Software-only extension samples](/ddk/microbit/extension-samples/).**

For the purpose of this example, let's assume we have an extension `https://github.com/company/pxt-thing/` with blocks in the `thing` namespace.

### Step 1: preparing the new extension

We are going to create a new _nested_ extension that adds Jacdac and hides the existing blocks.

-   open https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/ **make sure to use the beta until all fixes are released**
-   import your repository url with **/jacdac** appended. This will create a new extension in the same repository (if your repo is https://github.com/company/pxt-thing/, import https://github.com/company/pxt-thing/jacdac).

-   rename the project to `thing-jacdac` where `thing` is the name of your package (remove `pxt-`)
-   switch to **JavaScript**
-   expand the **Explorer** view and delete `main.blocks`
-   add the Jacdac extension to the project (search for `jacdac`)
-   copy the following template in `main.ts`

```typescript
//% deprecated
namespace TODO_REPLACE_THIS_WITH_BLOCK_NAMESPACE {}

namespace modules {
    // TODO:  add client instances here
}

namespace servers {
    function start() {
        // TODO: update with new program identifier
        // jacdac.productIdentifier = ...
        // TODO: add short device description
        // jacdac.deviceDescription = ...
        jacdac.startSelfServers(() => [
            // TODO: instantiate servers here
        ])
    }
    start()
}
```

-   replace `TODO_REPLACE_THIS_WITH_BLOCK_NAMESPACE` with the namespace that contains your blocks to hide them

### Step 2: add sensor servers

Many sensor servers are sensors that return a single numerical value.
These sensors can be implemented easily using `jacdac.createSimpleSensorServer`.

Let's assume that our extension has a function `thing.lightLevel()` that returns a number `[0..1023]` from a light sensor resistor.
We want to wrap this function as a [light level](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/lightlevel/) server.

-   start a `light level` simulator
-   click **Add Blocks** to import the light level constants and clients
-   update `main.ts` with the following code

```typescript
namespace servers {
    function start() {
        jacdac.startSelfServers(() => [
            jacdac.createSimpleSensorServer(
                jacdac.SRV_LIGHT_LEVEL,
                jacdac.LightLevelRegPack.LightLevel,
                () => thing.lightLevel() / 1023
            ),
        ])
    }
    start()
}
```

Notice that we rescale the value returned by `thing.lightLevel()` to match the `[0..1]` range.

-   start a **light level** simulator in the Jacdac dashbaord
-   click on **Add Blocks** to import the `jacdac-light-level` blocks
-   update `main.ts` with a light level client

```typescript
namespace modules {
    /**
     * The thing light level sensor
     */
    //% fixedInstance whenUsed block="thing light level"
    export const thingLightLevel = new LightLevelClient(
        "thing light level?dev=self"
    )
}
```

-   make sure to update the `thing light level` name in the comment, and contructor string
-   make sure to add `?dev=self` to the contructor name
-   test your extension, you should be able to use the simulator and the hardware values!

> Don't forget to create a release so that your latest code changes are picked up by MakeCode!

### Step 3: add actuator servers

Many actuators implement a `value` and `intensity` register. These servers
can be implemented using `jacdac.createActuatorServer`.

This example spins up a motor server.

```typescript
    jacdac.createActuatorServer(
        jacdac.SRV_MOTOR,
        jacdac.MotorRegPack.Speed,
        jacdac.MotorRegPack.Enabled,
        (server) => {
            const enabled = server.intensity > 0
            const speed = server.value
            setMotorSpeed(enabled ? speed : 0)
        }, {
        instanceName: "ML",
        statusCode: jacdac.SystemStatusCodes.Initializing,
    }),
```

### Questions?

For issues around your own extension, please file an issue at your extensions's Github repo and notify us at jacdac-tap@microsoft.com.

## Device Registration

To improve the user experience, register your accessory at https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/tools/device-registration/.
The user will be able to see a picture of the device and get more information from the dashboard.

### Step 1: Add product identifier

A product identifier will allow Jacdac and MakeCode
to provide a better experience to the user, like
showing a picture of pointing to a help page.
The first step is to generate a new id and
integrate it into the source.

-   generate a new product identifier

<RandomGenerator firmware={true} />

-   edit `main.ts` with the project identifier and a device description if you haven't updated it yet

```typescript
namespace servers {
    function start() {
        jacdac.productIdentifier = 0x....
        jacdac.deviceDescription = ...
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### Step 2: Register device

-   download your extension to a micro:bit
-   open https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/tools/device-registration/
-   connect to the micro:bit
-   import the device informatio

    n

-   finish the registration

## Advanced topics

These customization options are less common.

### Implement a custom server

If your module requires to implement another server, please reach out to the jacdac team at
https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/discussions.

### Hardware Initialization

Many accesories have to be initialized with a separate function call.
In such case, you should start the server in `initializing` state,
run the hardware initization in the background and set the server to `ready` when done.
Jacdac will not try to run the state of the sensor until it is ready.

Back to our example, let's assume `thing.init()` needs to be called before any other function.
We refactor the code as follows (see comments):

```typescript
namespace servers {
    function start() {
        ...
        jacdac.startSelfServers(() => {
            // step 1: store servers in array, we'll need those later
            const servers = [
                jacdac.createSimpleSensorServer(
                    jacdac.SRV_LIGHT_LEVEL,
                    jacdac.LightLevelRegPack.LightLevel,
                    () => thing.lightLevel() / 1023,
                    // step 2: start server in 'initializing' mode
                    {
                        statusCode: jacdac.SystemStatusCodes.Initializing
                    }
                ),
            ]

            // step 3: run initialization in background
            control.runInBackground(() => {
                // step 4: do native initialization
                thing.init()
                // step 5: tell servers hardware is ready
                for(const server of servers)
                    server.setStatusCode(jacdac.SystemStatusCode.Ready)
            })

            // step 5: return the servers
            return servers
        })
    }
    start()
}
```

### Pin 12: disable single wire serial

If your hardware is already actively using pin 12 (`P12`), you will need
to disable the Jacdac single wire serial transport.
Add the following code anywhere in your project.

```typescript
namespace userconfig {
    export const PIN_JACK_TX = 0xdead
}
```

### Multiple same services

If your device has multiple of the same service, like multiple buttons, servos, motors,
you will want to make sure to explicitely specify the `service offset` in the role name.

Going back to our example, let's assume that we have 2 light sensors on the device,
where the second light sensor is read using `thing.lightLevel2()`.

We start by add a second light level sensor in the `start` function.

```typescript
function start() {
    jacdac.startSelfServers(() => [
        jacdac.createSimpleSensorServer(
            jacdac.SRV_LIGHT_LEVEL,
            jacdac.LightLevelRegPack.LightLevel,
            () => thing.lightLevel() / 1023
        ),
        jacdac.createSimpleSensorServer(
            jacdac.SRV_LIGHT_LEVEL,
            jacdac.LightLevelRegPack.LightLevel,
            () => thing.lightLevel2() / 1023
        ),
    ])
}
```

Then we add a second light level client in the `modules` section
and we add `&srvo=...` arguments to the role name. `srvo` stands
for the `service offset`, the index in the list of same service offset (not the absolute service index).
In this case, the index in the list of light level services.

```typescript
namespace modules {
    /**
     * The thing light level sensor
     */
    //% fixedInstance whenUsed block="thing light level"
    export const thingLightLevel = new LightLevelClient(
        "thing light level1?dev=self&srvo=0"
    )
    /**
     * The **second** thing light level sensor
     */
    //% fixedInstance whenUsed block="thing light level 2"
    export const thingLightLevel = new LightLevelClient(
        "thing light level 2?dev=self&srvo=1"
    )
}
```
