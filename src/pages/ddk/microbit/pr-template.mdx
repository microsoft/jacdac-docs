This pull requests add support for Jacdac for this accessory which allows users to use simulators in MakeCode. Jacdac support will be released in the next major release of MakeCode for micro:bit (summer 2022).

-   This change adds a new nested extension (`jacdac` folder)
and does not modify the existing extension. **Your existing lessons, tutorials and blocks are not impacted by this change.**
-   No hardware modification is required for existing accessories, this feature
is [backward compatible](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/). However, it requires a micro:bit V2 to run.

The benefits for the users and you will be:

-   **Simulator** Jacdac enables simulations of all sensors and actuators
-   **Digital twins** Jacdac surfaces the hardware state directly into the MakeCode editor
-   **Standardized blocks and lessons** the programming will be done through
Jacdac blocks maintained by the Microsoft team

We recommend reading the [Jacdac software only accessory](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/) documentation page to learn more 
about the details of this approach. You can also review a list of similar [software only extensions](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/microbit/extension-samples/).
