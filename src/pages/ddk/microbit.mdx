# micro:bit Accessories

Jacdac can be integrated into existing and future micro:bit accessories with different level of investment.
Jacdac brings **simulators** and **digital twins** of sensors/actuators:

-   **simulators** allows the user to easily test sensor/actuator without having to use the hardware
-   **digital twins** provides a live view on the sensor/actuator state
-   **standardized blocks** provided by the Jacdac project, means you have to maintain less extensions for your hardware

As of today, Jacdac runs on **micro:bit V2** exclusively and uses pin **12**.

Overview:



## Level 0: Existing accessories

In this level of integration, the accessory does not have to have any hardware support for Jacdac (and may also be using pin 12).
By providing a new extension that exposes the sensors as Jacdac server, the users will benefit from **simulators** and **digital twins**.
This level of integration can be applied to any existing micro:bit accessory, with or without hardware support (Remember that this only applies to micro:bit V2 board).

### Integration steps

-   [ ] fork your existing extension that supports your board and remove all the block annotation
-   [ ] add references to the service client libraries to pull in the service constants
-   [ ] add a function that launches servers for each sensor
-   [ ] wire up the function to start when running on hardware

```ts
namespace myExtension {
    function start() {
        if (!jacdac.isSimulator()) {
            // start servers only on hardware
            TODO
        }
        //
        if (jacdac.checkProxy()) {
            // custom proxy code
            jacdac.proxyFinalize()
        }
    }
    start()
}
```

If your hardware is already using pin 12, disable that feature in Jacdac

```ts
TODO
```

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulation
    -   digital twin
-   Cons
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   no Jacdac connector

## Level 1: Unpowered physical connector

In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, with the JD_DATA line connected to micro:bit pin 12 through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design#signalling) circuit.

-   [ ] Jacdac data line requirements TODO

On the software side, the same approach applies in Level 0.

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   Jacdac connector at minimal cost
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   Unpowered connector means user has to add a power source on the Jacdac bus

## Level 2: Powered physical connector

In this scenario, the Jacdac connector is powered using the required regulation circuit documented at ...

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   Powered connector means module will just work when connected
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   additional cost for power regulator

Note that if your accessory already has a power regulator, you might already have the required circuitery in place.

## Level 3: Onboard Jacdac server with MCU

In this scenario, the accessory contains an MCU that implements the Jacdac server protocol.
In this case, you do not need to provide any extension as the user will be able to use the built-in Jacdac client libraries.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no extension required
    -   compatible with any Jacdac hardware, including Raspberry Pi
-   Cons
    -   MCU and power regulator circuitery add cost
