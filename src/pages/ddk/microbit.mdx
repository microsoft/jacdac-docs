# Jacdac/micro:bit V2 Interoperability

## The benefits of using Jacdac with micro:bit

In addition to the instant 'connect and code' nature of Jacdac, it brings three additional key features to all sensors and actuators that might be used with micro:bit:

-   **simulators** allows users to easily test sensors and actuators, even if they don't have the hardware to-hand;
-   **digital twins** provide a live view of the physical sensor/actuator state directly in the micro:bit code editor; and
-   **standardized blocks** provided by Jacdac reduce confusion for users and reduce the overhead for creators of new sensors and actuators.

As of today, Jacdac on micro:bit requires a **micro:bit V2**.

## Three different approaches to supporting Jacdac

There are three main approaches to integrating Jacdac with exsiting and furuter accessories for the micro:bit V2:
1. **Software-only** support requires no changes to accessory hardware—so Jacdac can work with accessories already in the market. This approach is also the easiest to implement.
2. Adding a Jacdac connector and a minimal amount of interface circuitry to an accessory allow it to communicate with other Jacdac devices over the Jacdac bus. A Jacdac **power consumer** can also be powered from the Jacdac bus.
3. Adding a Jacdac connector (as in 2, above) and a little additional circuitry  allows the accessory to be a **power provider** that can power other Jacdac devices. This provides the best user experience.

There is technically a fourth option, independent power, but for most scenarios this gives the least good user experience so we do not recommend it for micro:bit scenarios.

Each approach offers different benefits and requires different levels of investment.
These options are depicted below:

## 1. Software-only Jacdac for existing accessories

In this approach, sensors and actuators built into an accessory are surfaced as Jacdac servers by wrapping the existing extension into a Jacdac compatibility layer.
**This solution adds no cost and will work for existing accessories.**

-   Pros:
    -   **works with existing accessories**;
    -   sensor and actuator simulation, digital twins and standardized blocks;
    -   no modification to existing extension code; and
    -   same github repository for code.
-   Cons:
    -   extension still required; and
    -   no Jacdac connector is available to users.

For more details see our page on [implementing software-only Jacdac for micro:bit accessories](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/).

## 2. Adding a Jacdac connector for a power-consuming accessory

In this scenario, one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) must be integrated into the accessory design.

The Jacdac data signal (JD_DATA) must be connected to micro:bit pin 12 through a  [signal conditioning circuit](/ddk/design/electrical#signalling) that protects the micro:bit from spurious signals and provides electro-magnectic compatibility (EMC). 
Jacdac was designed to minimize the complexity and cost of this circuity.

Note that Jacdac on micro:bit always uses pin **12**. Until now, this pin has largely been reserved for accessibility applications, so many existing accessories do not use it. We believe that Jacdac provides a route to more accessible peripherals that work with micro:bit, in addition to supporting many more scenarios.

In order to [consume power](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-consumers) from the Jacdac bus power line (JD_PWR), most power-consuming accessories will need a voltage regulator; we recommend a low-dropout linear regulator (LDO)—which might already be included in an accessory design. If the accessory also has one or more alternative power sources, protection will be needed to prevent back-powering; we recommend a Schottky diode. 

-   Pros
    -   sensor and actuator simulation, digital twins and standardized blocks;
    -   no modifications to existing extension code are required; and
    -   same github repository for code.
-   Cons
    -   a hardware revision of the accessory that incorporates the Jacdac signal conditioning circuit is needed; and
    -   extension required.

## 3. Adding a Jacdac connector for a power-providing accessory

In this scenario, as above, one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) must be integrated into the accessory design. The same [signal conditioning circuit](/ddk/design/electrical#signalling)  is required, as described above.In addition, a few extra components are needed to implement [power provision](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-provider-current-limiting). In particular, a current limiting circuit is mandatory. 

-   Pros
    -   sensor and actuator simulation, digital twins and standardized blocks;
    -   no modifications to existing extension code are required; 
    -   same github repository for code; and
    -   the powered connector provides the best user experience—modules will always just work when connected to the bus.
-   Cons
    -   a hardware revision of the accessory that incorporates Jacdac signal conditioning and power provison circuits is needed; and
    -   extension required.

## Designing a Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2

One approach to designing a Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2 is to use a micro:bit edge connector socket that the micro:bit plugs into in order to take power from the micro:bit and connect to pin 12. The micro:bit V2 is limited in the current it can supply to accessories (such as a Jacdaptor), so it's not possible to build a high current [power provider](/ddk/design/electrical/#overview-of-jacdac-power-sharing). As a low current power provider, the [power protocol](/services/power/) does not need to be implemented, so the Jacdaptor does not need its own MCU. It does need a current limiter with auto-retry, and it also needs a DC-DC boost converter to increase the micro:bit's output voltage to reach the [Jacdac bus voltage](/ddk/design/electrical/#bus-voltage-range).

A reference design showing how to implement a micro:bit Jacdaptor as described above is in the [Jacdac electronics design repository](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/deprecated_form_factor/altium_deprecated/jacdaptor-reference-designs/JacdacMicroBitShieldLP%2029-0.6). Note that the form factor of this design (the board shape and mounting hole details) are deprecated.
