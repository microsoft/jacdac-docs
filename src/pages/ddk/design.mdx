# Hardware Design

## Overview

The hardware design requirements for all Jacdac devices are organized into three sections:
- [Electrical](./electrical)
- [Electro-mechanical](./electro-mechanical)
- [Mechanical](./mechanical)

Please ensure any devices with a physical Jacdac connector you design conform to these design requirements. 

## EC30 module form factor

In addition to the above requirements for any device that supports the Jacdac electrical interface, there are further benefits for users and for manufacturers if devices follow the [EC30 module form factor](./ec30). These additional design guidelines support the use of Jacdac breadboards, enclosures and a suite of design tools that are under construction. 
If you are considering creating a Jacdac module or brain, we strongly recommend it conforms to the EC30 form factor.

## Jacdac reference designs

The Jacdac team and the community have provided hardware and firmware reference designs for a variety of EC30 Jacdac devices, based on very low cost components including [PADAUK](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) MCUs. We have designs in common electronics CAD tools, many of which are also available in PDF, Gerber, STEP and Parasolid form:

- [Altium Designer](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/altium),
- [EAGLE](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/eagle), and 
- [KiCad](https://github.com/hardwaremonkey/jacdac).

## Support for device manufacturing

Throughout the design of Jacdac we considered aspects of device manufacturability, to ease the process of manufacturing and testing device hardware and thereby minimize cost. Please refer to the page on [manufacturing](./manufacturing).
