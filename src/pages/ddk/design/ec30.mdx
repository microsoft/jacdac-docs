# EC30 Device Form Factor

[![EC30 schematics screenshot](./ec30.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/ec30/JacdacEc30Template20x20-80-1.0.PDF)

To make it easier for users to recognize Jacdac devices, and for the devices to work with various electro-mechanical
and mechanical accessories, we recommend the use of the [EC30 module form factor](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/ec30/JacdacEc30Template20x20-80-1.0.PDF).
In particular, the form factor was designed to make it easier to
build cheap enclosures for individual devices, and to assemble groups of devices together to make an integrated product.

The EC30 rectangular form factor has one or more _Jacdac edge connectors_ on opposite sides of the PCB, four _mounting
holes_, and an _orientation notch_ indicating the upper-left of the board (viewed from the top side of the the PCB). There is always at least
one Jacdac edge connector on the left.

In addition to the sections below, make sure to read up on the [electrical](../electrical) and [electro-mechanical](../electro-mechanical) design guidelines.

## Dimensions

The centers of mounting holes should be a multiple of 10mm apart in both x and y directions. The outline of the board extends 2.5mm from the holes to give a basic width of 25.0 by 25.0mm, but note that Jacdac edge connector(s) extend by a further 1.5mm.

The smallest module is rectangular, with holes spaced 10.0mm in x and 20.0mm in y, leading to 18.0 by 25.0mm overall. The smallest "square" EC30 module is 28.0mm (x-axis) by 25.0mm (y-axis).

<!--The difference is due to the fact that the two edge connectors, oriented parallel to the x-axis, protrude 1.5mm from each side of the board.-->

## Edge connectors

Each [Jacdac edge connector](../electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) is 6.6mm wide with clearance on each side to accommodate the cable connector and leave space for a "connector wall". If the Jacdac edge connector is not directly next to another, there should be exactly 2.7mm clearance; if more than one connector are adjacent they should be on a 10.0mm spacing, leaving 3.4mm between them, with exactly 2.7mm clearance on either side.

## User feedback: status LEDs

EC30 Jacdac devices should have at least one status LED indicating [module and bus status](/reference/led-status/). 
This can be a single color **orange** LED or a three-color RGB LED. The status LED may be disabled by the user to reduce current consumption. RGB LEDs may also put into a mode where the color is controlled by the user.

There should be at least one status LED **on each side of the device** that has edge connectors. The position of the LEDs is in the [Jacdac EC30 specification](https://aka.ms/jacdac-ec30).

## Mounting hole names, electrical connections, and size

The mounting holes are named and connected as follows:

-   **MH1** is at the _upper-left_ corner of the board and is connected to _JD_DATA_, with the orientation notch immediately to its right
-   **MH2** is at the _upper-right_ corner of the board and is connected to _GND_
-   **MH3** is at the _bottom-left_ corner of the board and is connected to _JD_PWR_
-   **MH4** is at the _bottom-right_ corner of the board and is connected to _GND_

Mounting holes have a finished (plated) diameter of 3.1mm, with a 4.4mm diameter annular copper ring, and a solder resist keepout of 5.0mm diameter.

The mounting holes must be on 10mm pitch. This allows the modules to be mounted on a pre-drilled/perforated plate that has holes every 10mm in each direction.

### Example application: PCB mounting base

The [base prototype board](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbase86v41/) allows to mount and connect various sizes of EC30-shaped modules without using cables.

## Outside layers routing keepout

Because the mounting holes and Jacdac edge connectors are electrically connected, it is important to define keepouts for other routing.
In particular, each mounting hold has a 6.0mm diameter keepout, while each edge connector has a rectangular keepout. No copper (except 
for the mounting hole net) can be in the mounting hole keepout areas to prevent shorts when mounting.

## Component placement keepout

The component placement keepout provides clearance for mounting bushes, connector wall, and other mounting features.

## Silkscreen marking

The module name should be printed on the top surface of the PCB, to the right of the orientation notch.

## Component layout considerations

We recommend that the ESD diodes that protect JD_DATA and JD_PWR are placed between the Jacdac edge connector and the two mounting holes that carry those signals so they are close to both and provide protection before those nets move further on to the PCB. 

If there are multiple Jacdac edge connectors, especially at opposite ends of the device, we recommend the use of multiple pairs of ESD diodes.
