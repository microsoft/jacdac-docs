## PCB edge connector

[![Jacdac PCB edge connector technical drawing](./JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/connector/JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.pdf)

A PCB edge connector was chosen for Jacdac primarily because it is cheap and easy to implement. The PCB must be 1.6mm ±10% thick from conductor to conductor at the point of the edge connector. It must use gold plated electrical contacts with at least 0.05μm (2μ") gold plating to ensure the contact resistance and mate/unmate cycle lifetime can be met. Electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) is acceptable. Thicker gold (e.g. 3μ") will increase the lifetime of the PCB edge connector.

The three electrical contacts are on 1.27mm (0.05”) pitch. The JD_DATA contact is shorter than the JD_PWR and GND contacts to ensure it is the last to make electrical contact. The PCB must be at least double sided, and the three electrical contacts must be present on both sides of the edge connector; this allows the mating connector to be attached either way up. The contacts on the top and bottom sides of the PCB must be connected electrically using traces and/or vias on the PCB. We provide Jacdac PCB edge connector libraries for some electronics CAD tools including Altium, Eagle and KiCAD [here](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/connector).

The mechanical mating and umating process relies on two small, unplated slots in the Jacdac PCB edge connector. These should be 0.7mm wide (±0.1mm), i.e. milled with a 0.7mm diameter router. In addition, three plated through-holes are required as part of the Jacdac PCB edge connector to support future extensions of the Jacdac specification. These must be 0.71mm diameter (+0.15/-0.05mm) after plating, with an annular ring of diameter 1.11mm (±0.1mm).

Please refer to the [technical drawing of the Jacdac PCB edge connector](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/connector/JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.pdf) for full details. Note how the Jacdac electrical contacts are shorter on the bottom side of the PCB because they must not connect electrically to the adjacent plated through-holes.

There are two optional improvements which provide a better connection. Electroplated 'hard gold' may be used instead of ENIG for the Jacdac contact, and this provides better durability. Also, the end of the Jacdac PCB edge connector can have a bevelled or chamfered edge of between 30° and 60°. This reduces the initial mating force required to attach the mating connector. The PCB manufacturers may require that this is specified manually as an annotation in the gerber files or as a note in a README file. Note that both of these features (hard gold and bevelled edges) are optional.

##  Cable connectors and assemblies

A purpose-built cable connector is used to interface with the Jacdac PCB edge connector desribed above. The cable connector is reversible (i.e. it is 180° rotationally symmetric) but internally it only needs to have contacts on one side due to the double-sided design of the Jacdac PCB edge connector.

Together with the Jacdac PCB edge connector, the mating half must give a mating and unmating force of 5-15N and each of the three electrical connections it provides should have a contact resistance of 30 mΩ or less and a current capacity of 1A DC. These characteristics should be consistent for a lifetime of at least 1500 mate/unmate cycles.

Jacdac cable assemblies contain three conductors and are terminated at both ends with a Jacdac cable connector. The wiring is 'straight through' . i.e. it connects JD_DATA at one end to JD_DATA at the other, JD_PWR to JD_PWR and GND to GND. The conductors used for JD_PWR and GND must have a resistance of at most 135mΩ/m and be capable of carrying a continuous DC current of 1A. This translate to 26AWG (e.g. 30/0.08) or thicker. We suggest an ultra-flexible insulator such as silicone or another thermpostic elastomer (TPE).

The first manufacturer of Jacdac cable connectors and cable assemblies is [Dongguan Yuliang Electronics](http://dgyuliang.net/) who are also known by their [Cylconn](http://www.cylconn.com/) brand.

## Multiple connectors

In the simplest configuration, all devices on a Jacdac bus are connected directly to the three Jacdac signal wires. This is easy to achieve with just two devices - they are simply connected together using a single cable. Jacdac supports two mechanisms for connecting more than two devices to the same Jacdac bus:

-   **Daisy-chaining**: Jacdac devices may have a connector at each end of the PCB to enable end-to-end "daisy-chaining".
-   **Hub devices**: Jacdac devices may include several Jacdac PCB edge connectors to allow direct connection to more than two other devices.
-   **Decidated hubs**: Jacdac hubs are simply double-sided PCBs with mutiple Jacdac PCB edge connectors, wired to connect all JD_DATA signals together, all JD_PWR signals together and all GND signals together. They need contain no electronic components.

## Mounting holes

Where Jacdac modules include mounting holes, we recommend that these be plated-through hole (PTH) and electrically connected to the Jacdac bus signals JD_PWR, JD_DATA and GND. This provides additional mechanisms for connecting modules together instead of the PCB edge connector, including the use of metal screws, threaded stand-off pillars, 'banana' style jack plugs and soldering.

If PTHs are used, we recommend the use of four holes, one in each 'corner' of the module. 
We recommend the use of 3mm holes, per the [EC30 module form factor](../ec30), 
although we have also found 2mm holes useful if a small module size is important.

Two of these must be connected to the GND net, and the other two connected to JD_DATA and JD_PWR. We suggest that the latter two are located adjacent to the Jacdac PCB edge connector so that the traces that connect the PTH to the edge connector fingers can be short and therefore share a common ESD diode. If the JD_DATA and JD_PWR PTHs are more than 10-15mm from the PCB edge connector, we recommend additional ESD protection.  See [EC30 module form factor](../ec30) for more details on the recommended placement and dimensions of the four mounting holes, copper plate ring,
solder resist, and keepout (necessary to ensure that screw heads and the bodies of standoffs do not interfere with any components on the PCB or short any traces 
near the hole).

### Four 2mm plated-through holes (deprecated)

Some previous Jacdac modules used 2mm mounting holes.

Use holes with a finished diameter of 2.1mm, annular copper ring of 3.0mm diameter & copper/component keepout of 5.0mm. The keepout is necessary to ensure that screw heads and the bodies of standoffs do not interfere with any components on the PCB or short any traces near the hole.

The mounting holes must be on 2.5mm pitch. This allows the modules to be mounted on a pre-drilled/perforated plate that has holes every 2.5mm in each direction.
