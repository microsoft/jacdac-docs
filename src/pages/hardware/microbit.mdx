# micro:bit Accessories

This page is intended to guide micro:bit accessory vendor in integrating Jacdac.

Jacdac can be integrated into existing and future accessories with different level of invesment.
When supported, Jacdac brings **simulation** and **physical twin** of sensors:

-   **simulation** allows the user to easily test sensor conditions without having to use the hardware.
-   **physical twin** provides a live view on the sensor state
-   **standardized blocks** provided by the Jacdac project, means you have to maintain less extensions for your hardware

## Limitations

As of today, Jacdac runs on **micro:bit V2** exclusively and uses pin **12**.

## Level 0: Existing accessories

In this level of integration, the accessory does not have any hardware support for Jacdac (and may also be using pin 12).
By providing a new extension that exposes the sensors as Jacdac server, the users will benefit from **simulation** and **physical twin**.

This level of integration can be applied to any existing micro:bit accessory, with or without hardware support (Remember that this only applies to micro:bit V2 board).

### Integration steps

-   [ ] fork your existing extension that supports your board and remove all the block annotation
-   [ ] add references to the service client libraries to pull in the service constants
-   [ ] add a function that launches servers for each sensor
-   [ ] wire up the function to start when running on hardware

```ts
namespace myExtension {
    function start() {
        if (!jacdac.isSimulator()) {
            // start servers only on hardware
            TODO
        }
        //
        if (jacdac.checkProxy()) {
            // custom proxy code
            jacdac.proxyFinalize()
        }
    }
    start()
}
```

If your hardware is already using pin 12, disable that feature in Jacdac

```ts
TODO
```

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulation
    -   physical twin
-   Cons
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   no Jacdac connector

## Level 1: Unpowered physical connector

In this scenario, you add a [Jacdac PCB connector](/hardware/connector) and a data line to pin 12 with the required filtering in place.
The connector is not powered to avoid adding the cost of a voltage regulator.

-   [ ] Jacdac data line requirements TODO

On the software side, the same approach applies in Level 0.

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulation
    -   physical twin
    -   Jacdac connector at minimal cost
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   Unpowered connector means user has to add a power source on the Jacdac bus

## Level 2: Powered physical connector

In this scenario, the Jacdac connector is powered using the required regulation circuit documented at ...

-   Pros
    -   simulation
    -   physical twin
    -   Powered connector means module will just work when connected
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   additional cost for power regulator

Note that if your accessory already has a power regulator, you might already have the required circuitery in place.

## Level 3: Onboard Jacdac server with MCU

In this scenario, the accessory contains an MCU that implements the Jacdac server protocol.
In this case, you do not need to provide any extension as the user will be able to use the built-in Jacdac client libraries.

-   Pros
    -   simulation
    -   physical twin
    -   no extension required
    -   compatible with any Jacdac hardware, including Raspberry Pi
-   Cons
    -   MCU and power regulator circuitery add cost
