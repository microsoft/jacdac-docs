# LED Animation Designer

Design LED animation patterns for LED strips or module status light.

```
{
    repetitions: u16
repeats:
    hue: u8
    saturation: u8
    value: u8
    duration8: u8 8ms
}
```

* ``repetitions`` determines the number of runs of the animation, ``0`` is interpreted as infinite.
* each animation frame is a color (in Hue Saturation Value format) and a duration
* the module will interpolate between each animation frame
* for the status light, specify up to **8** animation frame
