# Getting Started with Jacdac

Jacdac is a platform for quick and easy prototyping of new
electronic experiences. You can get started with Jacdac on this 
web site without needing to acquire any hardware, as described
below. You can also visit the [device catalog](/devices) to see
what Jacdac devices available and follow the guides available for
working with them.

## The device dashboard and simulators

Visit the [device dashboard](/dashboard),
which allows you spin up simulators for many Jacdac [services](/services).

[![dashboard simulator pane](/start/dashboardSimulators.png)](/dashboard)

Each Jacdac service describes a basic electronic feature, such as a
[button](/services/button) or [temperature sensor](/services/temperature).
Start a button simulator and temperature (thermometer)
simulator, by clicking on the button and thermometer icons in the simulator pane. 
Clicking on tool (wrench) on the upper left will open the device
tree view showing the properties of the services associated with the two 
simulators:

## Programming with simulators

Once you are familiar with the simulators, you can dive into programming 
with simulators using a variety of [client programming languages](/clients)
supported by Jacdac. **These very same programs will work against Jacdac devices**, 
no software change required, when connected to the computer (brain) running 
the client code; a brain could be a low-powered Jacdac device or a laptop/desktop computer.

### MakeCode

To get started programming with MakeCode, browse the [MakeCode Jacdac projects](/clients/makecode/projects). 
From here, you can open MakeCode directly with the push of a button,
loading the needed Jacdac libraries. MakeCode has in-browser programming and 
integrates the Jacdac simulators into the debugging experience. 

[Read more](/clients/makecode) about the integration of Jacdac with MakeCode.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

If you program in JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to 
execute Jacdac applications.  [Read more](/clients/javascript) about the Jacdac TypeScript APIs and 
the [Jacdac object model](/clients/javascript/jdom). You can use the [Jacdac Command Line Interface](/clients/cli), 
a Node.js program, to start a local websocket server that acts as a bridge between the Jacdac dashboard and a 
your code.  This allows you to run your code using the latest version of the web 
developer tools. 

When building web-hosted Jacdac Javascript programs,
Jacdac's [JavaScript debugging tools](/clients/javascript/debugging) are a must.

[Read more](/clients/more#web-integration) about other Jacdac web integration points,
including React and hosting Jacdac in an IFrame.
