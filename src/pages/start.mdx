# Getting Started with Jacdac

Jacdac is a platform for quick and easy prototyping of new
electronic experiences. You can get started with Jacdac on this 
web site without needing to acquire any hardware, as described
below. You can also visit the [device catalog](/devices) to see
what Jacdac devices available and follow the guides available for
working with them.

## The device dashboard and simulators

Visit the [device dashboard](/dashboard),
which allows you spin up simulators for many Jacdac [services](/services).
Each Jacdac service describes a basic electronic feature, such as a
[button](/services/button) or [temperature sensor](/services/temperature).
Start a button simulator and temperature (thermometer)
simulator, by clicking on the button (1) and thermometer icons (2) in the simulator pane,
as shown below:

[![dashboard simulator pane](/start/dashboardSimulators.png)](/dashboard)

Clicking on tool (wrench) on the upper left (3) will open the device
tree view showing the properties of the services associated with the two 
simulators:

![button and temperature simulators, and device tree](/start/buttonAndTemp.png)

Explore the various properties by expanding the elements in the
device tree view on the left and note how they update when you 
interact with the simulators.  Each simulator is represented by a
virtual Jacdac device running two Jacdac services:
a control service (generic to all Jacdac
devices) and the specific service (button and temperature, in the above example)
that exposes its basic functionality.

## Programming with simulators

Once you are familiar with the simulators, you can dive into programming 
with simulators using a variety of [client programming languages](/clients)
supported by Jacdac. **These very same programs will work against Jacdac devices**, 
no software change required, when connected to the computer (brain) running 
the client code; a brain could be a low-powered Jacdac device or a laptop/desktop computer.
The Jacdac object model and supporting runtime is available in TypeScript, .NET, and
Python, as well as MakeCode. 

### MakeCode

To get started programming with MakeCode, browse the [MakeCode Jacdac projects](/clients/makecode/projects). 
From here, you can open MakeCode directly with the push of a button,
loading the needed Jacdac libraries. MakeCode has in-browser programming and 
integrates the Jacdac simulators into the debugging experience. 

[Read more](/clients/makecode) about the integration of Jacdac with MakeCode.

### .NET

[Get started with .NET](/clients/dotnet/getting-started/)
to program with Jacdac (no hardware requred) in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp) 
or [F#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/fsharp). After this, you can 
try out some of the [.NET Jacdac Projects](/clients/dotnet/projects/). 

### JavaScript/TypeScript

If you program in JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to 
execute Jacdac applications.  [Read more](/clients/javascript) about the Jacdac TypeScript APIs and 
the [Jacdac object model](/clients/javascript/jdom). You can use the [Jacdac Command Line Interface](/clients/cli), 
a Node.js program, to start a local websocket server that acts as a bridge between the Jacdac dashboard and a 
your code.  This allows you to run your code using the latest version of the web 
developer tools.  When building web-hosted Jacdac Javascript programs,
Jacdac's [JavaScript debugging tools](/clients/javascript/debugging) are a must.

[Read more](/clients/more#web-integration) about other Jacdac web integration points,
including React and hosting Jacdac in an IFrame.

### Python

[Get started with Python](/clients/python/), which also supports connecting to the web-hosted device dashboard.
More projects coming soon.
