# Getting started with Jacdac

Jacdac is a platform for quick and easy prototyping of new
electronic experiences. You can get started with Jacdac on this
web site without any special hardware, as described
below. But Jacdac is better with Jacdac modules! Visit the [device catalog](/devices) to see
what Jacdac devices are available and follow the guides available for
working with them.

## The device dashboard

Visit the Jacdac [device dashboard](/dashboard) and connect your device
which allows you to visualize the **device twins** for each connected modules.

Each connected module will automatically appear in the device dashboard as a **device twin**,
mirroring the state of the device. Each Jacdac service describes a basic electronic feature, such as a
[button](/services/button) or [potentiometer](/services/potentiometer).


If **your micro:bit does not connect** to the Jacdac device dashboard, try downloading the [micro:bit Jukebox](/clients/makecode/microbit-jukebox/) onto your micro:bit. In addition to reacting to Jacdac modules as they are plugged in, the micro:bit will pass Jacdac communications to your computer over USB.

## Simulators

Start a button simulator and slider simulator, by clicking on the button icon and then searching for the slider simulator
as shown below:

## Programming with simulators

Once you are familiar with Jacdac simulators you can dive into programming
using a variety of [client programming languages](/clients)
supported by Jacdac. Programs developed using simulated devices **will also work with real Jacdac devices**,
no software changes required! Just connect some or all of the devices used by your code to your computer and re-run
your client code. You can also program a Jacdac 'brain' to run your client code, so that your project works even
when the Jacdac devices are not connected to a computer.

The Jacdac object model and supporting runtime is available in [JavaScript/TypeScript](/clients/javascript),
[.NET](/clients/dotnet), and [Python](/clients/python), as well as [MakeCode](/clients/makecode).

### MakeCode

To get started programming with MakeCode, browse the [MakeCode Jacdac projects](/clients/makecode/projects).
From here, you can open MakeCode directly with the push of a button,
automatically loading all the relevant Jacdac libraries. MakeCode has in-browser programming and
integrates the Jacdac simulators into its in-browser debugging experience.

### .NET

[Get started with .NET](/clients/dotnet/getting-started/)
to program with Jacdac (no hardware required) in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp). After this, you can try out some of the [.NET Jacdac Projects](/clients/dotnet/projects/).

### JavaScript and TypeScript

If you program in JavaScript and/or TypeScript, you can use create a web page or a Node.JS script to execute Jacdac applications. Read more about the [Jacdac TypeScript APIs](/clients/javascript) and
the [Jacdac object model](/clients/javascript/jdom).

You can also use the [Jacdac Command Line Interface](/clients/cli),
a Node.js program, to start a local websocket server that acts as a bridge between the Jacdac dashboard and a
your code. This allows you to run your code using the latest version of the web
developer tools.

Read more about other [Jacdac web integration points](/clients/more#web-integration),
including React and hosting Jacdac in an IFrame.

### Python

[Get started with Python](/clients/python/), which also supports connecting to the web-hosted device dashboard.
More projects coming soon.
