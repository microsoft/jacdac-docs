## Challenge 1: Build Switch Access System ( for next/select, scan-mode-control, ...)

### Background:

Switch access allows people with limited mobility and/or reach to use phones, tablets, and PC's via the use of switches. The switches are of many forms (big buttons, capapcitive-buttons, sip&puff switches, etc).

### Problem / Challenge

While the software is common and sometimes free by default (for example on Android and iPhones) affordable hardware is not common or cheap => and it could / should be. All that is needed is system to send a unique keyboard-hid-event for 1 or 2 switches. The event can be sent over USB or Bluetooth to the host-device.

Sub-challenge is to see how cheap we can build this. If someone is using a $50 Android phone, they won't pay $200 for switch-access-hardware but they may be $10. Can we build a system that sells for $10?

## Challenge 2: Build an External Scan Mode System

### Background:

Control a device (PC/tablet/phone) or application with just a single button with an external scan-mode implementation. This is needed because not all applications support switch-access-mode. With an external scan-mode system, we can use 1 (or 2) buttons to emulate each function of a mouse. We do this by "scanning" thru modes and selecting which mode you want the button to be in. The button can "move left", "move right", "move up", "move down", "left click", "right click", "middle click", "click and hold", ...

### Problem / Challenge

The hardware is not difficult but off-the-shelf-solutions are not common. We just need a button, a brain, some LED's and a little code. Reference the example at the link below

## Challenge 3: Home Automation Systems Accessible Control

### Background:

Home automation systems are a nicety for the general public => they can be a godsend for those with accessibility-needs.

### Problem / Challenge

The systems are very powerful but can be slightly out-of-reach/use for some. They can also be vulnerable to hacking so adding security would be a bonus.

## Challenge 18: Address hack "Beacons to Guide Blind People Home"

### Background:

Copied from the hackbox page: _Nowadays, the housing pattern in cities is dominated by high-rise elevator room. Elevators, as the accelerator for high-rise residents, can also be obstacles for blind residents on their way out or home. The first obstacle is that the number buttons in some elevators are not marked with Braille, but blind people can often find the target buttons by memorizing the relative positions of the specific buttons. The second obstacle is that most elevators have not been equipped with voice broadcast, which is a defect more difficult to cope with in terms of barrier-free design. When blind residents take the elevator home alone, they may be "lost" at the house door because they are confused about which floor the elevator has reached. This project aims to develop a sound positioning device for the blind people's “going home” problem, and is now recruiting technical partners to participate in appearance design and structural design. Taking wireless doorbells as the reference, this positioning device consists of a transmitter (button) and a receiver (sounder). The appearance of the transmitter is close to a keychain or an Air Tag, which is convenient for the blind people to carry. The receiver can be attached to a number of "reference points" to facilitate localization, including but not limited to elevator doors, stairways, the doors of the house and the unit buildings, etc. When the blind people press the transmitter, with the help of the receiver's sound, they are able to determine whether they have reached the target location (sound information) and how to approach the location (direction information)._

## Challenge 19: Rebuild a previous hack: But build it faster / better via Jacdac

### Background:

There are many examples of successful (and failed / stalled) hacks that could be good material for Jacdac.

Example could be to rebuild Jon Campbell's eyegaze gaming / RC-car control => but use eyegaze to build it faster/better/different

I strongly encourage people to search thru the older abilityhacks => there are many great ideas in there (most of which were not completed)

## Challenge 21: (MMC Challenge) Many users need Thin / Small Trackpad that supports Gestures

### Background:

There are some people that have limited dexterity and wrist and arm movements. Normally when you use a track pad you are using a combination of movements in your fingers, wrists and to some degree your forearms. There are some users that only have limited range of motion in the plane parallel the surface of the track pad (can move their fingers forward and back and side to side) and their range of motion is one half to one third of the surface of a typical track pad. Unfortunately they have problems elevating their fingers and wrist in the vertical plane. So they find it difficult to deal with even the typical track pad on a laptop as the thickness of the laptop is a barrier. With the limited range of motion also comes typically a lack of strength.

### Problem / Challenge

They are looking for a very thin (in vertical direction) track pad with a smaller surface area (due to their limited range of motion of their fingers). They also want to still be able to use gestures such as the double tap due to the lack of strength to deal with mouse buttons.

Paul Kos 21/10/04: **I think a great hack here could be to leverage the touchpad from Mavis** (Arc Touch Mouse)[https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Arc-Mouse-ELG-00001-Black/dp/B072FG8LBV/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=B072FG8LBV&psc=1] I don't know if we will have time for this hackathon - but will check. The touch-surface is small, it supports multi-touch and gestures. We disabled most gestures in shipping product as we didn't see need for them => but its very feasible to enable them and to build a tiny great touchpad.

## Challenge 22: (MMC Challenge) Some Accessibility Users want ThinkPad-like Control

### Background:

There are some people with a limited range of motion and still have reasonable strength in their fingers. These users can benefit for the J-mouse configurations that came on the laptops of a few years ago. It is similar to the mouse you see in the Lenovo T410 keyboard (link below)

Essentially they are small pezio-resistive or strain gauge joysticks that can act as a mouse. They will need a small left and right mouse buttons located close to the joystick due to their limited range of motion.

## Challenge 23: (MMC Challenge): Hack "Inverted" Style Mouse - like the Ring Mouse

### Background:

We have seen a few ring style mice. This is a link to a Genius Ring Mouse:

(Genius 2.4GHz Wireless Mouse (Genius Ring Mouse 2) : Amazon.ca: Electronics)[https://www.amazon.ca/Genius-2-4GHz-Wireless-Mouse-Ring/dp/B00BJE3V52#:~:text=%20%20%20Brand%20%20%20%E2%80%8EGenius%20,x%2012.2%20centimeters%20%201%20more%20rows%20]

It uses similar technology as an optical mouse except your drag you finger over the optical sensor which is the top of the ring. Alternatively you can push one of the four direction arrows buttons that surround the optical sensor surface to move the mouse cursor.

There is a button that acts as the left mouse button.

We bought one but it does not work well. The tolerances in the construction means the direction buttons and left mouse buttons are inconsistent when activated.

Again this would be suitable for someone with limited range of motion and some minimal strength in their fingers to activate the buttons on the mouse.

It does not recognize the double tap as a left mouse click if I remember right. The double tap would be the preferred left mouse button activation method for many people as they may lack strength though they have some range of motion..

**Paul Kos 2020/10/04:** We did build a tiny optical-mouse-sensor Jacdac-module but I am not sure we will have the FW in-time for this hackathon (let's try). We also experimented with similar things in the past. It's great feedback to know that there is need in the accessibility-space for this use-case. We can definitely support this in the near-future. Need to check if the module we are using can support this - or if we need to use a different model sensor.

## Challenge 24: (MMC Challenge): Build more HID-generating Features into Touchpad-HW so they can Work with Mobiles

### Background:

Most of the mice and touch pads have the double tap left mouse click activation built into the drive on the host side. Obviously this does not exist in most mobile devices when they act as hosts. It would be better to embed that feature directly into the external track pad so they can be used with mobile devices.

### Discussion:

**Paul Kos 2020/10/04:** This could be really fun to experiment with. I imagine the goal is to build something in a way that it gives the vision-impaired-user some subtle-feedback when they get near something. As I think the sensor would be going off all the time. If the feedback (perhaps a type of haptic) was subtle enough it would be like someone just tapping your shoulder to warn you there is an obstacle ahead.
