# Jacdac for MakeCode and the micro:bit V2

**Posted on June 17th, 2022 by Jacdac Team (jacdac-tap@microsoft.com)**

We are delighted to announce the public debut of Microsoft's [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) platform for plug-and-play creation and programming of physical computing systems. Jacdac brings three exciting enhancements to MakeCode for the micro:bit V2:

1. **[modular accessories](#modular-accesories)** with plug-and-play cables, shown above;
2. **[unified coding blocks](#unified-block-coding-for-accessories)** for all accessories;
3. **[hardware simulators and device twins](#hardware-simulation-and-device-twins)** for micro:bit accessories.

A [micro:bit V2](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/) is required for deployment to hardware, as Jacdac needs more resources than available on the original micro:bit. Jacdac is [backward compatible with existing micro:bit accessories](#backward-compatible-with-existing-accessories). If that's enough for you, see our [call to action](#call-to-action) for MakeCode users and micro:bit accessory manufacturers. Otherwise, read on...

## Modular accesories

Jacdac is a hardware+software platform for the plug-and-play creation and programming of physical computing systems. A “brain”, in this case a micro:bit V2, executes the user’s program, while a set of modular accessories—or modules—provide additional capabilities, as shown below:

### Kittenbot's Jacdac Starter Kit A

[Kittenbot](https://www.kittenbot.cc) is making [Jacdac Starter Kit A with Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdacstarterkitawithjacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/), shown at the beginning of the blog and featured in the above video, available for purchase this summer in limited quantity. This first commercially-available kit features seven Jacdac modules, shown below. Kittenbot’s [Jacdaptor for the micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/) has six Jacdac edge connectors that can be used to connect to Jacdac modules via the Jacdac cables.

## Unified block coding for accessories

Jacdac provides a large set of [services](/services) to describe the high-level functionality of hardware, both existing micro:bit accessories and new Jacdac modules. The [button service](/services/button), which represents any push button, is one of the simplest Jacdac services. Services enable programming against any hardware that supports the services, regardless of the manufacturer, with standardized MakeCode programming blocks, as shown in the next video, which also features hardware simulators and device twins.

## Hardware simulators and device twins

From the beginning, a web-based micro:bit simulator has been an essential part of the discovery process for the BBC micro:bit. For almost every service, Jacdac provides a simulator that integrates seamlessly into MakeCode, as well as a “device twin” that displays the status of a connected accessory. The simulators let you program against Jacdac services without needing the hardware. The video below shows the use of the button simulator and device twin. Note that the program continues to function when the keycap button is replaced by a rotary button, as both modules support the button service.

## Backward compatible with existing accessories

Jacdac has been designed so that it can be used with existing micro:bit accessories, even if the hardware does not support the Jacdac connector. For example, the [Kitronik STOP:bit traffic light board](https://kitronik.co.uk/products/5642-stopbit-traffic-light-for-bbc-microbit)
is described by the [traffic light service](/services/trafficlight). In the video below, you can see how the Jacdac simulator for the traffic light service is incorporated into MakeCode. We have created [Jacdac samples of extensions](/ddk/microbit/extension-samples/) for a variety of micro:bit accessories.

## Call to action

### MakeCode users

To get started with Jacdac for MakeCode and the micro:bit, users have several options:

-   **Jacdac kits available**: see the [device catalog](/devices)!
-   **Software for existing accessories**. Try out a micro:bit accessory with a [Jacdac MakeCode extension](/ddk/microbit/extension-samples).
-   **Jacdac hardware simulators**. Try out [Jacdac Projects for MakeCode](/clients/makecode/projects) right away, using Jacdac simulators.

### Micro:bit accessory manufacturers

Jacdac provides manufactures of micro:bit accessories [several options](/ddk/microbit):

-   **Software for existing accessories**. We have created a way to add Jacdac support to MakeCode extensions for existing accessories. We have added Jacdac to several MakeCode extensions as [samples]((/ddk/microbit/extension-samples). [Read more](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/) about software-only Jacdac.
-   **Add a Jacdac edge connector to your designs**. It’s inexpensive to add the 3-wire [Jacdac edge connector](/ddk/microbit/#low-powered-physical-connector) to your accessory.
-   **Make your own Jacdac modules** using the Jacdac [Device Development Kit](/ddk).
