# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I get Jacdac devices?

Please visit the Jacdac [device catalog](/devices) to find what devices are available and where to purchase them.

## Can I use Jacdac without hardware?

Yes! Jacdac provides web-based simulators for most of its [services](/services),
and has been integrated with web-based programming environments like [MakeCode](/clients/makecode).

## Why Jacdac?!

Good question! Over the years we have experimented with and used many existing solutions, but we
found they weren't as low-cost, reliable, robust, and dynamic as we'd like. We wanted a instant, 'plug-and-play' experience that 'just works' every time. 

We like USB, but for embedded electronics it's inherently quite high cost and limited by its host-peripheral design.

I2C is much cheaper to implement—and lots of ICs have it built in—but it has a number of limitations. Devices are only standardized at the signalling level, meaning you need a new driver in your software environment for every single accelerometer. Supporting multiple instances of the same I2C device adds complexity because of address collisions. I2C was originally designed for on-PCB communication, and although it's been extended to work over longer distances the underlying signalling protocol relies on passive pull-ups which still limits data rate and cable length. 

## The Jacdac connector and cable

### Why not use stereo audio jacks and cables?

We did in fact use 3.5mm stereo audio jacks and cables in some of our Jacdac prototypes. The main issue is that they are not designed to carry much power (Jacdac cables are rated at 1A). We bought and tested lots of different stereo audio cables and found that many of them had a resistance of several ohms, which introduces too much voltage drop at higher currents—a real problem if you want to run a servo or even a several neopixels.
Another issue is that the connectors typically short-circuit while plugging-in and -out; although Jacdac is designed to be robust to this, it does cause data loss and/or device resets—not a great end-user experience. Also, stereo audio cables are long - they take up quite a bit of space. 

Finally, using stereo audio cables is ultimately just confusing. Users expect them to carry audio signals! There is the risk that users might plug Jacdac cables into headphones and/or mobile phones, possibly causing damage.

### Why not use Qwiic connectors and cables?

[Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) connectors and cables are nice and compact, but are not designed for easy or frequent plugging-in and -out. Jacdac cables are easy to use and designed to be plugged and unplugged thousands of times. Also, due to the nature of I2C, Qwiic cables tend to be quite short, whereas Jacdac cables can be a meter long or more, and can be extended.

### How did you come up with the Jacdac connector design?

Having decided a new connector was necessary, optimized for the applications we had in mind for Jacdac, several factors influenced our design.
- **Easy to use**: We've all struggled to work out which way up the USB cable is meant to be. Many of us have fiddled with, scraped our skin and/or bent our nails on JST connectors. We wanted something that was a intuitive, fun and foolproof to connect.
- **Low cost**: We wanted a simple design that would be cheap to implement.
- **Easy to source**: Even if a component is cheap, if it's hard to get hold of that's a problem. We wanted to minimize the friction of adopting Jacdac. 

By using a PCB edge connector format—where the connector is part of the PCB itself—we have truly minimized cost. There are no physical parts to buy and nothing to solder down. At the same time, we've removed any sourcing overhead. Of course, the Jacdac cable connector is a physical part, but users don't need to source individual cable connectors—they only need Jacdac cable assemblies. So we are only introducing one new type of part into the ecosystem.

## Can I make existing hardware work with Jacdac?

Yes! Jacdac is designed to be interoperable with a wide range of existing platforms via [Jacdaptors](/reference/jacdaptors/). 

In some cases it's possible to use Jacdac without any new hardware at all! See how Jacdac provides a [software-only](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory) solution for existing micro:bit accessories.

## How can I add the Jacdac edge connector to my hardware?

We've tried to make it easy to add Jacdac. 

Firstly, you need to add the [PCB edge connector](https://aka.ms/jacdac-edge-connector). Your PCB **must be 1.6mm thick** and use gold plating to use Jacdac; if this is not possible then consider mounting a small Jacdac PCB onto your main PCB. There are more details [here](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical/#pcb-edge-connector).

Next, you need to add the Jacdac interface circuitry. At the very least there are a few passive components/diodes, see [here](/ddk/design/electrical/#signalling). The filtered Jacdac bus data line, JD_POWER_MCU, must be connected to a microcontroller (MCU) that's running the Jacdac protocol. If your hardware already has an MCU, this may be sufficient; but it's also possible to add an MCU. Either way, we have [reference firmware implementations](/ddk/firmware/) of the Jacdac protocol. 

You need to decide on the best [power supply scheme](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing), depending on the user experience you want to deliver. Jacdac modules that don't draw a lot of current are probably best implemented as pure power consumers, requiring only a cheap voltage regulator. Jacdac brains, that users are likely to plug other Jacdac modules into, are probably best as power providers—which means they need to have a simple current limiter circuit. 

## Can I modify an existing Jacdac device design?

Yes! We provide a number of Jacdac device hardware and firmware reference designs with an open license for the community to use as-is and modify. If you do this, we'd love it if you share the things you build so that others may benefit in turn—but don't feel obligated to do this.
