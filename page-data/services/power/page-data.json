first few packets can be even sent more often)\n* If an enabled power service sees a `shutdown` command from somebody else,\n  it disables itself (unless in grace period)\n* If a disabled power service sees no `shutdown` command for more than ~1200ms, it enables itself\n  (this is when the previous power source is unplugged or otherwise malfunctions)\n* If a power service has been disabled for around 10s, it enables itself.\n\nAdditionally:\n* While the `allowed` register is set to `0`, the service will not enable itself (nor send `shutdown` commands)\n* When a current overdraw is detected, the service stop providing power and enters `Overload` state for around 2 seconds,\n  while still sending `shutdown` commands.\n\n### Client notes\n\nIf a client hears a `shutdown` command it just means it's on a branch of the\nnetwork with a (high) power provider.\nAs clients (brains) typically do not consume much current (as opposed to, say, servos),\nthe `shutdown` commands are typically irrelevant to them.\n\nFor power monitoring, the `power_status_changed` event (and possibly `power_status` register)\ncan be used.\nIn particular, user interfaces may alert the user to `Overload` status.\nThe `Overprovision` status is generally considered normal (eg. when two multi-channel power providers are linked together).\n\n### Server implementation notes\n\n#### A dedicated MCU per channel\n\nEvery channel has:\n* a cheap 8-bit MCU (e.g. PMS150C, PFS122),\n* a current limiter with FAULT output and ENABLE input, and\n* an analog switch.\n\nThe MCU here needs at least 4 pins per channel.\nIt is connected to data line of the channel, the control input of the switch, and to the current limiter's FAULT and ENABLE pins.\n\nThe switch connects the data line of the channel (JD_DATA_CHx) with the internal shared data bus, common to all channels (JD_DATA_COM).\nBoth the switch and the limiter are controlled by the MCU.\nA latching circuit is not needed for the limiter because the MCU will detect an overcurrent fault and shut it down immediately. \n\nDuring reception, after the beginning of `shutdown` frame is detected,\nthe switch is opened for a brief period.\nIf the `shutdown` frame is received correctly, it means it was on MCU's channel.\n\nIn the case of only one power delivery channel that's controlled by a dedicated MCU, the analog switch is not necessary. \n\n#### A shared MCU for multiple channels\n\nEvery channel has:\n* a current limiter with FAULT output and ENABLE input, \n* an analog switch, and\n* a wiggle-detection line connecting the MCU to data line of the channel\n\nThe MCU again needs at least 4 pins per channel.\nSwitches and limiters are set up like in the configuration above.\nThe Jacdac data line of the MCU is connected to internal data bus.\n\nWhile a Jacdac packet is being received, the MCU keeps checking if it is a \nbeginning of the `shutdown` frame.\nIf that is the case, it opens all switches and checks which one(s) of the channel\ndata lines wiggle (via the wiggle lines; this can be done with EXTI latches).\nThe one(s) that wiggle received the `shutdown` frame and need to be disabled.\n\nAlso, while sending the `shutdown` frames itself, it needs to be done separately\nfor each channel, with all the other switches open.\nIf during that operation we detect wiggle on other channels, then we have detected\na loop, and the respective channels needs to be disabled.\n\n#### A brain-integrated power supply\n\nHere, there's only one channel of power and we don't have hard real time requirements,\nso user-programmable brain can control it.\nThere is no need for analog switch or wiggle-detection line,\nbut a current limiter with a latching circuit is needed.\n\nThere is nothing special to do during reception of `shutdown` packet.\nWhen it is received, the current limiter should just be disabled.\n\nIdeally, exception/hard-fault handlers on the MCU should also disable the current limiter.\nSimilarly, the limiter should be disabled while the MCU is in bootloader mode,\nor otherwise unaware of the power negotiation protocol. \n\n### Rationale for the grace period\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n* device A queues `shutdown` command for sending\n* A receives external `shutdown` packet from B (thus disabling A)\n* the A `shutdown` command is sent from the queue (thus eventually disabling B)\n\nTo avoid that, we make sure that at the precise instant when `shutdown` command is sent,\nthe power is enabled (and thus will stay enabled until another `shutdown` command arrives).\nThis could be achieved by inspecting the enable bit, aftering acquiring the line\nand before starting UART transmission, however that would require breaking abstraction layers.\nSo instead, we never disable the service, while the `shutdown` packet is queued.\nThis may lead to delays in disabling power services, but these should be limited due to the\nrandom nature of the `shutdown` packet spacing.\n\n### Rationale for timings\n\nThe initial 0-300ms delay is set to spread out the `shutdown` periods of power services,\nto minimize collisions.\nThe `shutdown` periods are randomized 400-600ms, instead of a fixed 500ms used for regular\nservices, for the same reason.\n\nThe 1200ms period is set so that droping two `shutdown` packets in a row\nfrom the current provider will not cause power switch, while missing 3 will.\n\nThe 50-60s power switch period is arbitrary, but chosen to limit amount of switching between supplies,\nwhile keeping it short enough for user to notice any problems such switching may cause.\n\n## Registers\n\n    rw allowed = 1: bool @ intensity\n\nCan be used to completely disable the service.\nWhen allowed, the service may still not be providing power, see \n`power_status` for the actual current state.\n\n    rw max_power? = 900: u16 mA {typical_max = 900} @ max_power\n\nLimit the power provided by the service. The actual maximum limit will depend on hardware.\nThis field may be read-only in some implementations - you should read it back after setting.\n\n    enum PowerStatus : u8 {\n        Disallowed = 0\n        Powering = 1\n        Overload = 2\n        Overprovision = 3\n    }\n    ro volatile power_status: PowerStatus @ 0x181\n\nIndicates whether the power provider is currently providing power (`Powering` state), and if not, why not.\n`Overprovision` means there was another power provider, and we stopped not to overprovision the bus.\n\n    ro current_draw?: u16 mA @ reading\n\nPresent current draw from the bus.\n\n    ro volatile battery_voltage?: u16 mV {typical_min = 4500, typical_max = 5500} @ 0x180\n\nVoltage on input.\n\n    ro volatile battery_charge?: u0.16 / @ 0x182\n\nFraction of charge in the battery.\n\n    const battery_capacity?: u32 mWh @ 0x183\n\nEnergy that can be delivered to the bus when battery is fully charged.\nThis excludes conversion overheads if any.\n\n    rw keep_on_pulse_duration? = 600: u16 ms @ 0x80\n    rw keep_on_pulse_period? = 20000: u16 ms @ 0x81\n\nMany USB power packs need current to be drawn from time to time to prevent shutdown.\nThis regulates how often and for how long such current is drawn.\nTypically a 1/8W 22 ohm resistor is used as load. This limits the duty cycle to 10%.\n\n## Commands\n\n    command shutdown @ 0x80 {}\n\nSent by the power service periodically, as broadcast.\n\n## Events\n\n    event power_status_changed @ change {\n        power_status: PowerStatus\n    }\n\nEmitted whenever `power_status` changes.\n","title":"Power"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1089213825","2744294623","3360859391","3610498499","3868184074","4022945823","413816803","63159454"]}
