This report is typically not queried, when a device has an error, it will typically\nadd this report in frame along with the announce packet. If a service implements this register,\nit should also support the ``status_code_changed`` event defined below.\n\n    rw client_variant?: string @ client_variant\n\nAn optional register in the format of a URL query string where the client can provide hints how\nthe device twin should be rendered. If the register is not implemented, the client library can simulate the register client side.\n\n## Events\n\n    event status_code_changed? @ status_code_changed {\n        code: u16\n        vendor_code: u16\n    }\n\nNotifies that the status code of the service changed.\n","title":"Base service"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1089213825","2744294623","3360859391","3610498499","3868184074","4022945823","413816803","63159454"]}
