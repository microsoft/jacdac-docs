When we provide a pulse trigger signal with more than 10uS through signal pin, the Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger will issue 8 cycles of 40kHz cycle level and detect the echo. The pulse width of the echo signal is proportional to the measured distance.","connector":"grove","link":"https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor.html","storeLink":["https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor.html"],"services":[337275786],"productIdentifiers":[1068863164],"version":"2.0","status":"stable"},"title":"Ultrasonic Distance Sensor"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1089213825","1871237956","2744294623","3360859391","3610498499","3868184074","4022945823","413816803","63159454"]}
