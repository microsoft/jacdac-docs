##  Cables

A purpose-built cable connector is used to interface with the Jacdac PCB edge connector described above. The cable connector is reversible (i.e. it is 180° rotationally symmetric) but internally it only needs to have contacts on one side due to the double-sided design of the Jacdac PCB edge connector.

Together with the Jacdac PCB edge connector, the mating half must give a mating and unmating force of 5-15N and each of the three electrical connections it provides should have a contact resistance of 30 mΩ or less and a current capacity of 1A DC. These characteristics should be consistent for a lifetime of at least 1500 mate/unmate cycles.

Jacdac cable assemblies contain three conductors and are terminated at both ends with a Jacdac cable connector. The wiring is 'straight through' . i.e. it connects JD_DATA at one end to JD_DATA at the other, JD_PWR to JD_PWR and GND to GND. The conductors used for JD_PWR and GND must have a resistance of at most 135mΩ/m and be capable of carrying a continuous DC current of 1A. This translate to 26AWG (e.g. 30/0.08) or thicker. We suggest an ultra-flexible insulator such as silicone or another thermpostic elastomer (TPE).
